How will early spring and delayed autumn affect the growth of different tree species in the following year? I will present my masterâ€™s project and explain how I intend to measure and differentiate the growth increment between the treatments. For instance, I will display magnetic microdendrometers built by a lab at the University of Oregon, which will allow us to precisely analyze when the trees stop growing.
