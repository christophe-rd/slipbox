Regression:
Covariance matrix: Hapiness between eating a banana vs an apple. So two variable and the covariance is the degree of how they go together. If one variable is really positive and the other is really positive, their covariance will be high. However, if one is really positive, but the other is really negative, its covariance will be low. 
- Covariance and correlation are really similar, but correlation is restrained within 0 and 1, while covariance isn't.
