#### **Relevant notes**:
Molecular ecology shows a strong genetic basis for phenology whether it's driven by high phenotypic plasticity in phenology across a species' range with little genetic variation or cues, such as photoperiod that produces a static timing across years within sites. 
This is an obstacle because it means that pheno data taken from field observations include mixed signals. 
E.g. observations at one location of a wide-ranging species that triggers flowering predominantly by temperature, may not accurately trigger the within-species variation.
One solution to this is using time-series data that allows the modelling of plastic responses to interannual climate variation. Limitation: it assumes that cues are not locally adapted across a species's range and may introduce bias based on the local climate sampled.
