##### **Succession of ectomycorrhizal fungi under climate change at a logged high-elevation forest over 27 years**
2important things in fungi community:
1. Shift in amount of inoculum 
2. Change in environment e.g. chemical, biological, physical 
	1. E.g. clear cuts.
They showed a decreasing diversity of fungi proportional to how far they were from the clear-cutting. It was decreasing more a couple of years after the cutting. Just after : no change

2nd question: are we losing important function

##### Tracking Fall migration of Bank swallows - telemetry
She found weird patterns in the migration direction. Towers all accross north america are positionned so the emitters can send 

##### Beluga whales and drone surveys
**Pros of plane monitoring:**
Large scale
Cons: safety and high cost
**Pros of drones** :
Safety and low cost
**Sattelite imagery:**
Large scale
Safety
Instanteneous

They were wondering at what depth you can see the beluga whales, so they used a dummy to see how deep.

##### Change in space-use as abundance declines in Caribou herds.
She got data from the last 25 years. She had to keep only 8 colars/year as there was much fewer data from the early years compared to now. 
They use less area, but in summer they move more. Surprisingly. Might be because they have to forage more, therefore they are moving more. Don't know though

##### Isabelle Laforest
Maple seedlings at or beyond the species range show increase in fungal infections.

##### Rose Griffith
On forest harvesting in raparian zones (any area adjacent to a river)
What's cool, is that they studied the site before the logging, so they have data before and after. 

Some invertabrate species showed increases in abundance whereas some shown decrease --> because decrease in competition for resources 

Relative influence of harvesting differs because of the region. Species change, environement change.
Riparian harvesting have different impacts on insect sensitivity
