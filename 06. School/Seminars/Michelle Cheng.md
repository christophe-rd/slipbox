On insects
Why study insects' response to temperature:
- How communities are shapes
- Pollination and other applied ecology
Temperature affects biologic activity and other stuff. 

Temperature on body size: if hotter, insects are smaller. Called temperature-size rule. 

##### Bigger insects:
- Eat bigger prey
- Have more offspring
- Spread more diseases
- Carry more pollen

#### On phenology:
- Earlier spring, earlier emergence.
- They predict longer peak abondance with warmer temperature.
8 species shifted its peaked activity later in the seson
1 species shifterd earlier in the season 
only 1 has broden its activity 

Interesting relationship with introduced tree species planted in vancouver, but the insects are native.
