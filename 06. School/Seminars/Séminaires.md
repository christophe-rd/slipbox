**Question**: How do marine animals die? Either 1. Starvation, 2. Predation 3. Old age.

When they breed and hang out on the beach, they starve themselves. When they go fishing, they can gain up to 250kg.

Synchrony or asynchrony across individuals have consequences:
1. Asynchrony: decrease of pathogen transmission, resource competition, prey depletion, pollutant exposure, disturbance sensitivity.
	1. Challenge because more samples are necessary. 
2. Synchrony: opposite or asynchrony. 

The range at which the seals spread out more as far as they go through their life cycles events. They discovered the mechanism behind this observation --> they navigate and can modify their physiology because it depends a lot on daylength and stuff.

Marine mamals e.g. belugas, killler waves.
Did you observe any individual elephant seals go through post-reproductive lifespan. Benefit of
