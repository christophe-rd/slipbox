On Biodiversity and function in a stressed world. 
Trying to focus on environmental drivers from cities and how they impact ecossytem services.

From the urbanization effects on biodiversity: e.g. bird abundance not decreasing but their diversity decreases drastically. 
GUBIC consertium: group of researchers to work on urban ecology
- how cities influence movement and spread of species.
- Trying to understand processes happening in cities:
	- 1. connectivity
	- 2. Physical processes
	- 3. Socioeconomical pathways	- 4. ?
What the working group found is that the studies were analysing different things in different ways. 
Their urban plant dataset is focused on invasive species.
Erigeron canadensis is the species that was found the most in all 6 continents.
Africa is a huge donnor of species. So is Europe, but it's not the main one. 
Non-native species tend to have larger leaf area than native. 

We usually see a + realtionship between ecosystem functionnig/biodiversity. Meta analysis showed that the biodiversity effect was stronger under stressed envionements. Contradicting results from another study and system.
