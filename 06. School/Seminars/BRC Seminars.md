Bird phenology is shifting, but their ranges aren't. 
*Study conducted in Northern India*
Treeline: conifer, birch and rhododendron above.
Birds start signing early waiting for females at 3000 meters. They breed in birch forests
Nesting on the ground is best in birch forests and in trees in conifer forests. This is because of predation. Shifting ranges isn't easy.

There is a 10-day gap in snow disappearance between the different elevations and resources (here snow) match climate well. 
To achieve 1 degree, you can either lose 200 meter of elevation or breed 9 days (earlier/later).
CC brings loss of snow and larger temperature fluctuati2ons. 
Their data doesn't show that ranges aren't changing with climate. 

They showed that median breeding date is strongly correlated with temperature. 
But the phenology is not perfectly track temperature. The optimal strategy is plasticity. 
In 1985, the breeding was late. Most birds had eggs but most survived. 
Selection pressure to breed later because higher survival when eggs compared to hatched chicks.
