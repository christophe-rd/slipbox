#### On tropical mountain ecosystems
Primary productivity was thought to be a main driver of species diversity, but not for all groups. Temperature may be important for some groups.
Mountains are important refugias for species and they host 87% of the species on only 25% of land. 
One of his PhD worked on what drives the diversity of dung beetles (bousier).

Single taxas showed different elevational diversity patterns and different major drivers.

In natural ecoystems, plant diversity decreases with elevation, but for the anthropogenic areas, the pattern changes and it shows a curved shape that declines starting at a certain elevant.
Animal: similar, but it is stable until a certain treshold, where it drops steeply after this.

Microbes: declines slightly, but not much.
