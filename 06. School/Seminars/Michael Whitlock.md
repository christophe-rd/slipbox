Showed how molecular ecology worked in space. The assumptions behind  migration rates were overrated.
He is a pionneer in data archiving 

Going to talk about genetic basis for local adaptation.

Local adaptation causes allele frequencies to covary with environment. Hot allele associate with a hot environement and cold adapted allele is adapted to cold environment. Approaches to using genetic info for local adaptation:
1. Unsusual genetic differentiation among population (Fst outlier approach)
2. Correlataion between allele frequency and environment (GEA-Genotype Environment Association)
