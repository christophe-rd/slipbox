### Seminar grasslands
Grasslands are extremely threatened and we are using them a lot because they are easy to farm on. 
They did herbivore treatments for different plots. 
They found that herbivores are helping the species dispersal.
When herbivore affects grasslands communities, how it affects is really species specific. 

Herbivores will always have negative effect on demography, but they can have varied effects on dispersal
When herbivore pressure is at a certain threshold, they can have positive effects on dispersal speed, but it gets too high, the population crashes.3
