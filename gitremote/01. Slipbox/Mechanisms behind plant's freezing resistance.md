#### **Relevant notes**:
A major part of freeing resistance is to maintain membrane fluidity during the freezing process and to tolerate freezing-induced dehydration in the cell plasma.
- To do this, plants synthesize dehydrins and antifreeze proteins and reduce the amount of membrane-located carriers and receptors during the pre-hardening stage in late autumn. 
- Next, plants change the ultrastucture of the cytoplasm and increase the proline and polyol concentrations during the early stage of hardening. 
- The final stage of hardening is reached by a repeated exposure to freezing temperatures during dormancy in winter, leading to species-specific freezing resistance.
In spring, when the leaves emerge, they loose irreversibly their freezing resistance.
