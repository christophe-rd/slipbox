#### **Relevant notes**:
The long generation times are a challenge in tree research but they also provide adavantages:
1. Adaption to CC depends on phenotypic traits relevant to new environments, such as:
	1. Timing of growth and drought/cold tolerance. We have a low of into on quantitative genetics and population differentiation of trees because of the 250 years of forestry provenance trials.
2. The demographic history since the last glacial maximum has been reconstructed for a lot of species by combining phylogeographic and [[Palynology|palynological]] approaches with [[Coalescent Theory|coalescent-based]] studies of population demography. Rates of past adaptation to CC can be inferred from these studies.
