#### Relevant notes: 
Angiosperm transport water and nutrients from the soil to the leaves in specialized, capillary-like cells called vessels. They are larger in diameter than tracheids and transport water more efficiently but are more prone to embolism (air bubble formation during conduction that blocks water movement).

Angiosperms have more complex wood structures than gymnosperms. **Fibres** provide the key structure and support for the tree, but they also produce **vessels** that are used for the main water transport in the tree. They may have the following structures that are apparent in a cross-section:
- Large and small vessels
- Fibres
- Tracheids 
- Parenchyma cells: more common in hardwoods and form the ring boundary in some genera of [[Diffuse-porous wood|diffuse-porous species]]
