#### **Relevant notes**:
There is very rarely any above-ground growth happening below 5C and non-existent below-ground of the studied species. They showed that species from high elevations could grow at lower temperatures than those from low elevations. 

They show that species can grow at lower temperatures than those corresponding to their current range limit, but fail to produce mature tissue under these conditions, which limits winter survivorship.
