#### **Relevant notes**:

The meaning of Poole and Rathcke's test depends on the null hypothesis of randomly spaced mean flowering times. If there were one optimal time to bloom for all plant species, in the absence of competition, **all species would bloom simultaneously**. Their test is more rigorous than the other that presents a null hypothesis of simultaneous bloom (where a random phenology would doubtless be) because their null hypothesis corresponds to the more biologically interesting assumption of an **initially disorganized community composed**, e.g. of species colonising from a diversity of habitats. Deviation from this condition would suggest a community that had acquired some organization in response to displacement pressure.

Competition in such communities would result in competitive exclusion and selective retention of immigrant species or coevolution by character displacement of the initially random species assemblage. Either case would have various inhibitions to the emergence of a truly even phenology.
