#### **Relevant notes**:
**Context**: recently plant molecular ecology research focused on phenology has studied the underlying physiological and genetic structures that control flowering. This provides evolutionary insights into how local adaptation shapes intraspecific variation. 
To predict plant phenological responses, we need an understanding of abiotic versus biotic forces that drive selection in plant phenology. This is grounded on the concept of [[Temporal Niche|temporal niche]] i.e. that time is a primary axis by which plant species can partition ressources (e.g. nutrients, pollinators). Both abiotic and biotic forces can shape selection in plant phenology.
