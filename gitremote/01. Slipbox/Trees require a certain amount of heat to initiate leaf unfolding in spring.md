#### **Relevant notes**:
Boreal and temperate trees require a certain amount of heat after they come out of the dormancy period to initiate leaf unfolding in spring. Heat requirement is met sooner in warm springs. However, **heat requirement is negatively correlated with chilling** (accumulation of cold temperatures during the dormancy period). As the dormancy period warms during the study period, the accumulated chilling is progressively reduced, thereby increasing the heat requirement and slowing the advance of leaf unfolding. Â They tested this by calculating the accumulation of chilling (sum of days when air temp was between 0 and 5). They found a significant decrease in chilling accumulation for all species.
