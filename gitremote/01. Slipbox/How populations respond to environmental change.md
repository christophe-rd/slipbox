#### **Relevant notes**:
Populations can respond to environmental change through:
- Phenotypic plasticity
- Moving to a new area corresponding to environmental conditions they are adapted to
- By genetically adapting to the new conditions
- By a combinations of these responses.
Local adaptation is more common in trees than in some other plant species. Trees are adapted to the current climate and they are thus potentially greatly influenced by the rapid changes in climate.
