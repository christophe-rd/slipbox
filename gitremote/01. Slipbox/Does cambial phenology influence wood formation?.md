#### **Relevant notes**:
During the growing season, some variability exists in growth onset and duration because of intra-annual differences in weather, with cambium reactivation in spring being highly dependent on temperature. 
Wood formation involves [[Cell division in the vascular cambium|cambial cell division]] and cell expansion, followed by secondary wall production. They are regulated by gene expression and hormonal signals, as well as environmental factors, such as temperature and precipitation. 

They ask the question of whether there is a link between changes in cambial phenology and intra-annual wood formation.
- E.g. changes in the duration of wood formation induced by a change in cambial phenology might result in a modification to ring-width formation.

**Additional information** from a paper [[Xylogenesis varies across species and wood porousness|where this note comes from]]: In temperate forests where trees are dormant in the winter, reactivation of the cambium occurs in the spring when new cells start to form, followed by cell expansion, which determines tree radial growth. The rate of radial growth and the duration of cambial activity will determine the annual tree-ring.
