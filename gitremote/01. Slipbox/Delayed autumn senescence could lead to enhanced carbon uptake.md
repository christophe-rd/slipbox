#### **Relevant notes**:
**A prediction: 1 day of delayed leaf senescence = 98kg carbon/ha.** 
However, delayed [[Leaf senescence is controlled by photoperiod and temperature|leaf senescence]] doesn't necessarily translate to increased plant productivity. Warmer spring and summer can also lead to **earlier growth cessation**.
- Perhaps here: [[Earlier leaf-out might amplify drought in early summer]] *Fredi mentions that earlier spring means plants start taking up water earlier and could increase drought. Therefore, this could partially explain the earlier growth cessation*
[[Delayed autumn senescence could enhance carbon sequestration|Here, a meta-analysis suggest a similar consequence]]
