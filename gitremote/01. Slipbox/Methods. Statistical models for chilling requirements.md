#### **Relevant notes**:
They used 2 different mathematical models: 
1. Chilling hours Model:
	 Chilling hours model counts the number of hours during winter when temperatures are between 0 and 7.2 C.
2. Dynamic Model (superior in subtropical climates):
	The dynamic model assumes that winter chill is accumulated in a 2-step process. An intermediate chilling product is first formed by a process that requires cool temperatures. This intermediate product, whose formation is enhanced by moderate temperatures, can be destroyed by high temperatures. When a sufficient amount of intermediate product has accumulated, it's converted irreversibly into a chill portion.
