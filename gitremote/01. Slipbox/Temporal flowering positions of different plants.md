#### **Relevant notes**:
Robertson 1924: Every natural group of flowering plants has a definite position. It begins at a given time, increases to a maximum point and then declines until all of its members are out of bloom. **Their seasons do not coincide, but they overlap**
**They posed the question:** do life history and phylogenetic constraints influence the evolution of flowering phenology in the animal-pollinated plants of temperate floras?
They defice phylogenetic constraints to denote properties shared by the members of a monophyletic group by virtue of their common ancestry and which limit the response of these taxa to directional selection.
*We can only talk about phylogenetic constraints when the taxa studied are truly monophyletic.*
