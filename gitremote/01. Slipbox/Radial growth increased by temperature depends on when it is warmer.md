#### **Relevant notes**:
They hypothesized that seed set would be diminished, seed quality and viability would be reduced and germination would be less successful in high compared to low-elevation seed provenances were falsified.  
- There is no evidence that reproductive potential at the upper range limit is diminished under current climate conditions (for the species they studied. )

**Their results**:
- Radial growth of their trees always correlated with the growing season mean temperature, irrespective of elevation. 
- The annual variation of GS length has an effect on radial growth **only** when temperatures are generally warmer. 
- Because the time required for new cell formation increases nonlinearly with decreasing temperatures, a longer season at low temperatures will only produce a few additional cell rows, whereas a longer season at high temperatures can produce many more cell rows, particularly when spring is warm --> sets the size of the cambial zone.
