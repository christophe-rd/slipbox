#### **Relevant notes**:
There are two main approaches to predicting plant responses to climate change:
1. Observations over time or space to quantify sensitivities to temperature variability and change. This includes recent warming.
2. Experiments that directly warm natural plant communities on a small scale
Warming experiments have been used to extrapolate plant responses to future conditions. However, this approach rests on the critical but **little-tested** assumption that plant responses to experimental warming match long-term responses to global warming. Testing this assumption is essential if we want to assess the utility of warming experiments for long-term forecasting and prediction.
