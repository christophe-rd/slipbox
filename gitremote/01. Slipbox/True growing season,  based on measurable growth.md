#### **Relevant notes**:
The **"True" growing season** would be the **period at which a plant grows** (even if no increment in biomass)
- May cover the full year even in a temperate climate
###### Possible confusion:
- Literature refers to the growing season on the broader concept of plant development, for which the visible part of that is #phenology
	-  ==**Development**== reflects the transition across different physiological states and has two dimensions: 
		1. [[Ontogeny]]: lifelong
		2. [[Phenology]] : seasonal
##### Physiological activity relation to temperature. 
- For trees, passing of daily mean at 5Celsius  is critical for the beginning of the season
- A range between 5-8.5 Celsius is a minimum for cambial activity.
- End of the growing season, daily mean <5Celsius is a good proxy for the end of the growing season.
