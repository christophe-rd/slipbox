#### **Relevant notes**:
Their common garden experiments revealed small, but consistent genetic differentiation of spring phenology among [[Provenance|provenance]] of seedlings originating from different elevations, except for the treeline species which underlines the **importance of the timing of growth and development for tree success**. 
- *Fagus Sylvatica* from high elevation provenances flushed earlier than those at low elevations, as observed previously. 

Provenances from high elevations tended to set their buds earlier in autumn than low provenances. 

Overall, the phenology of populations from high elevations was less responsive to temperature and presumably more strongly tied to **chilling requirements** and/or **photoperiod** than low-elevation populations.
