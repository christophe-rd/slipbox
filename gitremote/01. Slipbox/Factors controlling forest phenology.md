#### **Relevant notes**:
The three most important factors controlling phenology in dominant forest tree species are: 
1. **Degree of winter chilling**
A lack of sufficient chilling in mild winters delays bud break. However, it may be partially replaced by long photoperiods and or very high temperatures.
3. **Photoperiod** 
Not all tree species are sensitive to photoperiod, but the long-lived, late successional species that become dominant in mature forests commonly are. Shorter lived-early successional species adopt are more risky life strategy. Poplars, and birch are usually opportunistic i.e. photoperiod insensitive in spring.
5. **Temperature**
Opportunistic taxa may profit from a warmer climate and thus gain a competitive advantage over photoperiod-sensitive taxa.
