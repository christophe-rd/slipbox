#### **Relevant notes**:
Xylem growth in tree trucks (what the fuck is that) sequestrates the carbohydrate produced by leaf photosynthesis, which contributes to the long-term carbon storage of forests. 
- Therefore, annual xylem growth is characterized as periodic [[Cambium activity produces early and late wood|cambium activity]]
- Its relationships with climate factors have been reported extensively and have attracted great attention. 
	- E.g. temperature triggers cambium activity in Northern Hemisphere conifers. 
- Also, recent studies suggest that photoperiods play an important role in controlling spring growth initiation.
