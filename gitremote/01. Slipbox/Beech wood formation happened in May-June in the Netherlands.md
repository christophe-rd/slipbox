#### **Relevant notes**:
In Northern Germany, wood formation data was combined with phenological data (Schhmitt et al. 2000) and in the Netherlands with long-term tree ring and climate (Werf van der et al. 2007)

Species studied: **Beech**. They showed that peak wood formation happened from the end of May to the beginning of June which is more than 2 weeks before the summer solstice. Wood formation in the Netherlands ended in October and in the Netherlands in September.
