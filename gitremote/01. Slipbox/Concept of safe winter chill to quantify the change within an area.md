#### **Relevant notes**:
They propose the concept of "safe winter chill," which is the amount of chilling that can safely be expected in 90% of all years and quantify the change in the area of safe winter chill for exemplary crop species. They believe that this metric is more useful for tree crop growers than mean winter chill, since it incorporates the economic need for an orchard operation to produce good yields in most years rather than in an average year.
