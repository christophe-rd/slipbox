#### **Relevant notes**:
- Since 1971, spring events in temperate latitudes have advanced by 2.5 days per decade. :
	- More precisions here: [[Earlier spring and delayed autumn events extend growing season]]
- This has consequences on plants since different factors control phenology depending on the plant type: 
##### [[Factors controlling forest phenology| Factors controlling phenology in]] :
###### Ornamental plants from warm regions:
1. Temperature
###### Early successional species (temperate latitudes)
1. Chilling (only become sensitive to temperature once their chilling demand has been fullfilled)
2. Temperature
They adopt a riskier strategy and are opportunistic (incentive to spring photoperiods)
###### Trees
1. Degree of winter chilling
2. Photoperiod
3. Temperature
A lack of sufficient chilling in mild winters might delay bud break. 
*Notes by Freddi: it has long been thought that fall phenology was mainly affected by photoperiod, but it isn't true anymore, many other factors affect leaf senescence.*
##### Reasons behind photoperiod sensitivity:
- Temperature varies strongly from year to year
- Therefore, sensitivity to photoperiod protects plants from the fatal consequences of simply tracking temperature "wrong" 
- Photoperiod controls: 
	- Formation of winter buds (induction of dormancy)
	- Leaf abscission meristems (induction of dormancy)
	- Freezing resistance  (induction of dormancy)
	- Growth onset
	- Reproductive events
- Temperature plays a role in modulating et triggering the visible progress of phenology
