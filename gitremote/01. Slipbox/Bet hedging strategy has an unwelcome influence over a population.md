#### **Relevant notes**:
Bet hedging is a risk-spreading strategy used by organisms in highly variable environments. 
In humans endeavours, it can be reflected in:
- E.g. hedge funds or "don't put your eggs in one basket".
It's also pervasive in the biological world, such as it's an unwelcome influence that spreads over a population.

Bet hedging may be involved in the characteristic of an organism that buffers it from temporal environmental variation. E.g. :
- Perennial life cycle
- Variable diapause in animals from crustaceans and mosquitoes to sponges and fish (Look for diapause)
- Resistance of weeds to eradication.

It's usually defined in terms of a trade-off between mean and variance of some performance criterion such as:
- Population growth
- Return on investment
- [[Darwinian fitness]]
