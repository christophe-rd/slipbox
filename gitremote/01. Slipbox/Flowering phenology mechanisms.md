#### **Relevant notes**:
To explain flowering phenology, most empirical and theoretical studies have followed the suggestion of Robertson 1895 that flowering time is modified by natural selection to avoid competition for pollinators. The fitness reduction driving this process may be the result of decreased seed-set caused by pollinator limitation, the low success of hybrid seeds produced by intraspecific pollination, loss of pollen, or pollen tube clogging.
