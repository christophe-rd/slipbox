#### **Relevant notes**:
Below is a cool table describing linear regressions of a) bud flush and b) budset along altitudinal and latitudinal gradients. It shows that the 2 pheno traits differ in their patterns. 
##### Bud Flush
Both altitudinal and latitudinal clines showed similar shallow slopes, but the **direction of adaptation varied greatly among species**. E.g. pop from high altitude Q. petrae flushed late whereas F. Sylvatica flushed early. **Reflects tradeoff between max growing season and spring frost.** 
##### Budset
Shows steeper slopes for both gradients and in all species more northern or higher altitude populations had earlier bud set. This indicates that differential selection on bud set is systematically stronger than on bud flush. **Bud flush may display higher phenotypic plasticity as temperatures increase.**
