#### **Relevant notes**:
Tree rings can provide additional information for evaluating cold adaptation since they provide a record of how past climate has influenced growth. 

Two anatomical features have been linked to cold and frost: 
1. layers of deformed, collapsed tracheids and traumatic parenchyma cells (frost rings). Frost years are years in which there was frost during periods of cambium activity. 
2. Light rings consist of layers of cells that are incompletely lignified and have been associated with frost events that kill the cells before the lignification process is complete.
