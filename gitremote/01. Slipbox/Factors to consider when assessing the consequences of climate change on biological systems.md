#### **Relevant notes**:
An impass of how to assess the consequences of climate change on natural biological systems comes from differences in perspective on what constitutes an "important" factor. Anyone would consider a currently strong driver to be important. But biologists also attach importatn to forces that are **currently weak but are likely to persist**.

How should climate fingerprint be defined:
- Economist would conclude that climate change was important if it were principally responsible for a high proportion of current biotic changes.
    - By this criterion, a climate fingerprint appears weak
    - Most short-term local changes are not caused by climate change but by land-use change and by natural fluctuations in the abundance and distribution of species.
    - This approach ignores small systematic trends tht may become important in the longer term. But they could be confounded by strong forces such as habitat loss.
