#### **Relevant notes**:
WAIS collapse could raise global sea level to 3.3 to 5 meters

In the Pleistocene, summer temperatures were much hotter and sea level were higher. There is no evidence whether WAIS completely collapsed at any time in the three million years since the Pliocene
WAIS collapsed when global mean surface temperature (GMST) was 0.5 to 1.5 C than the preindustrial. This suggests that the tipping point of future WAIS collapse is close. This will bring an significant increase in GMSL

This paper examined genetic variety in octopuses to see if genetic differences emerge between the different zones of Antarctica that could reveal if WAIS collapsed during the last interglacial.
