#### **Relevant notes**:
During the dormant season, woody tissues of deciduous plants, but especially 1-year-old twigs, store N mainly as storage proteins in the **bark**, but also as amino acids. 
When the active season resumes, N flows toward newly formed tissues. 
- Large amounts of N got to [[Rubisco|Rubisco]] in the leaves. When the active season ends, leaf senescence remobilizes a large proportion of the N back to the woody tissues.
