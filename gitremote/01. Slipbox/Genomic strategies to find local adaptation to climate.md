#### **Relevant notes**:
Two genomic strategies are commonly used to search for genes involved in local adaptation to climate:
1. Genotype-environment Association (GEA) method that looks for correlations between genetic markers and environmental variables from where populations/individuals originate
	    Does not provide information about the phenotypic traits controlled by the candidate genes.
2. Genotype-phenotype association; GPA: test for associations between genotypes growing in a common environment and traits of interest
	    **Advantage**: establish more direct links between genes and traits potentially under selection
        **Disadvantage**: in tree species, the list of functional traits that closely reflect adaptation to climate is still rather limited and labour-intensive.
