#### **Relevant notes**:
The accuracy of radial growth is questioned for investigating past forest productivity changes. 
1. Radial growth (talking about DBH here) of individual trees is sensitive to local competition dynamics driven by natural disturbances or sylviculture in managed ecosystems. These processes are independant of site fertility conditions. Therefore, radial growth of trees isn't considered a good indicator of stand productivity potential in forestry compared to mean height. Sampling of trees is usually restricted to dominant trees which experience lower competition intensity and belong to a fairly stable population over time. 
2. Radial growth is usually sampled at breast height. During severe climatic events, ring width reduction may be acute at breast height compared to other positions. Such events modify the relationship between ring size and tree volume increment.
