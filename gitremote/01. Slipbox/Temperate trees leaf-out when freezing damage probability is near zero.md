#### **Relevant notes**:
Leaf-out occurs when the probability to encounter freezing damage approaches zero irrespective of climatic conditions (low vs high elevation) and species (early- and late-flushing species.
- In other words, trees leaf out precisely at the beginning of the probabilistically safe period.
- Species with a small [[Safety Margins|safety margin]] against freezing like F. Sylvatica, employ photoperiod co-control of spring phenology. Species with a large safety margin depend more on temperature.
- Species that employ photoperiod co-control of leaf-out (E.g. F. Sylvatica) can leaf-out closer to the period with a high probability of freeing damage than species relying more strongly on temperature control.
