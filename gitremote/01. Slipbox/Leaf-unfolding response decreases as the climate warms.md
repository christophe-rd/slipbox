#### **Relevant notes**:
They showed VERY interesting results. The leaf unfolding decreased in response to climate change. 
###### They present 3 hypotheses:
1. **Adaptation to increased variance in spring temperature**
Possible effects of increased variance in temperature. Trees may develop conservative strategies (or higher phenological plasticity) of spring leaf unfolding in places where temperatures fluctuates more. E.g. to avoid spring frost damage.
2. **Photoperiodic limitations (due to earlier leaf unfolding) overriding temperature controls**
They have no evidence to exclude photoperiod as a controlling mechanism for the decline in spring unfolding as different populations may have genetic adaptations to photoperiod. 
[[Photoperiod as a protective mechanisms to prevent spring frost]]
[[Latitude and spring unfolding wouldn't be related]]
3. **Reduced duration and/or sum of cold temperatures during dormancy i.e. a lost chilling mechanism.**
As the dormancy period warms during the study period, the accumulated chilling is progressively reduced, thereby increasing the heat requirement and slowing the advance of leaf unfolding.
