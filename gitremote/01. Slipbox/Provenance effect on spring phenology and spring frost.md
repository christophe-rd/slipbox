#### **Relevant notes**:
Delays of leaf unfolding are reported and it is such that the period available to recover from spring frost damage becomes much shorter at high elevations. 
- It would explain why common garden using elevation gradients showed different spring phenology irrespective of actual weather.
- Thus, a short GS limits fruit ripening and seed maturation, potentially shaping northern distribution limits.
- In addition to seed maturation, latitudinal tree species distribution has been suggested to be limited by minimum metabolic requirements to fulfil life history traits.
