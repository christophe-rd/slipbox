#### **Relevant notes**:
Consequences of longer seasons at the individual level:
- Improve competitive ability if C uptake is not compromised by the potential damage of frosts. 
- Advancing leaf unfolding [[Earlier-leaf out can lead to spring frost|increases the risk of late-spring frosts]] that could kill new tissues and affect production. 
- Delayed leaf senescence could kill leaves before the completion of nutrient resorption during senescence and could reduce the nutrient reserves that support growth in the next season.
