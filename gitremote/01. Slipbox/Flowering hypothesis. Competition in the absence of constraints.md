#### **Relevant notes**:
It's been argued that flowering times are mostly due to the seasonal displacement of [[Sympatry|sympatric]], synchronously flowering competitors as a means of minimizing fitness reduction. Should lead to seasonal displacement of the flowering times of competitors throughout the season. If there is a selection for divergent flowering times in the absence of phylogenetic or life form constraints, a flora should have the following properties:
1. Families of a flora should not differ in flowering time. 
2. Selection for divergent flowering times should be strongest among members of a family, so there should be considerable selection pressure for species of a family to spread flowering times through the year
3. Members of a given family would have the same dates of flowering in different parts of the world only in the unlikely situation that selective pressures on flowering time are identical in the 2 regions.
