#### **Relevant notes**:
A recent study shows that an early season can promote tree growth in cold humid areas but inhibit tree growth in dry areas. 
- Droughts caused by warming have led to a decline in tree growth in many regions, including the northern hemisphere. 
- Drought may lead to xylem [[Embolism|embolism]], which affects water transport, reduces water use efficiency, [[Drought is the most widespread stress factor that affect forest carbon balance|reduces tree growth ]]and increases the possibility of disease and insect pests.
