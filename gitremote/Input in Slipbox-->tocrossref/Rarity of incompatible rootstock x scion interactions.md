#### **Relevant notes**:
**Reason why there is few data available on poor unions**: rootstocks have been selected for their compatibility with scions. Therefore, an incompatibility/a poor union would have been noticed if common. 
*As of 1993, there is no documented cases of such poor unions in a **disease free condition***.

This study finds that a disease can cause incompatibility
