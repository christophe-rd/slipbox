**Relevant notes**:
- Low water availability --> Cell expansion is turgor-limited, and it can affect growth, even more than photosynthesis.
	- It can lead to a passive buildup of excess NSC within the tree
	- E.g. tropical trees have lower growth rates and shoot elongation rates in the dry season. This observation is consistent to :
		- Turgor-induced sink limitation
		- Active growth suppression to avoid [[Carbon Starvation]]
