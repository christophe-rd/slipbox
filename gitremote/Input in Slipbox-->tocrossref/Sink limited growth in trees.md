**Relevant notes**:
- NSC pools are at a maximum during periods when the trees don't grow
- Here, I mention sink limitation as an environmental or developmental constraint that limits growth, since Carbon is still available. 
	- This is because trees have enough NSC to refoliate their entire canopy 4 times : [[Mature trees have plenty of NSC during growing season]]

**Cross references**: 
- [[Sink limited growth can be induced by warm or cold temperatures]]
- [[Sink limited growth can be induced by water availability]]
- [[Sink limited growth by reduction of cell expansion caused by drought]]
