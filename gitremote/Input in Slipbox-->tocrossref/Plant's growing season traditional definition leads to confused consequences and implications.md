#### **Relevant notes**:
- The traditional definition of the growing season is the combination of:
	- Internal control 
	- External forcing 
- As the #treeline debate for which the definition was not well defined/founded on the :
	- Notion of a line ;
	- The life form "tree" 
	- The confusion on the concept of the fundamental and realised niche
- In that sense, the growing season has different meanings and functional consequences. 

This paper developed 4 applicable definitions which are either centered aroung plant responses or on environmental conditions. Seasonal activities have [[Plants's internal control]] and [[Plant's external control]], both are driven by environmental cues. 

In ecology, a lot of events are gradual, and dormancy is one of them. It's hard to define it, but two definitions are here proposed and they are necessary to predict phenological events:
- [[Endodormancy]]
- [[Ecodormancy]]

###### The 4 definitions proposed are: 
- [[True growing season,  based on measurable growth]]
- [[Phenological season, based on visible phenological markers]]
- [[Productive season, based on primary production]]
- [[Meteorological season, based on environmental conditions]]
