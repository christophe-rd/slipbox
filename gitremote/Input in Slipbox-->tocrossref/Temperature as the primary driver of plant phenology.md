#### **Relevant notes**:
Temperature is the primary regulator of plant phenology. If warming results of earlier spring and delayed autumn, the **phenological responses to temperature changes is highly non-linear**.
1. Chilling activates a plant stress responses and stimulates plant [[Endodormancy]]. Then, a certain amount of chilling is required to break endodormancy and lead the plant to [[Ecodormancy]]. During this stage, the growth of meristem cells is stimulated and plant cell elongation accelerates under warm temperatures that is quantified as **growing degree-days.**
2. Spring phenology is more responsive to daytime warming than nighttime.
