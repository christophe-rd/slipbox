##### **Relevant notes**:
**In general BC
- The 2021 heat dome in BC is attributed to anthropogenic climate change. 
	- This is based on historic analyses
- Hundreds of local temperature records were recorded, for consecutive days at the same location
	- E.g. Lytton broke national record on : 
		- June 27 (46.6째C)
		- June 28 (47.5째C)
		- June 29 (49.6째C) 
	- Them Lytton was destroyed by wildfire on June 30
**Greater Vancouver** 
- Heat dome started building up on June 24 (46.6 째C) with increasing temperature until June 28
	- Very rare temperature from July 27th util July 03rd see [figures](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8835552/#:~:text=most%20of%20the%20heat-,dome,-.) 
	- Night temperatures : very high
	- Near peak daylight hours --> summer solstice
	- Stagnant air mass + solar radiation = high ground level ozone concentrations

##### **Questions**
- Is ground level ozone concentrations relevant to tree growth during a heat wave. Should we include it in Vancouver climate context in the paper?  [[2023-07-19]]
