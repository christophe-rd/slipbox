#### **Relevant notes**:
Differences in stem anatomy could explain why some co-existing species leaf out at different times. 
**Diffuse porous species**: produce small vessel elements throughout the growing season, tend to leaf-out earlier in the spring
- E.g. maples, birches, alders and poplars. 
- Their small vessel elements are less susceptible to embolism during the winter, which allows them to begin to meet the demands of transpiration earlier in the growing season.
**Ring porous species**,  have less uniform vessel elements, producing larger vessels in the spring and smaller ones later in the growing season. 
- E.g. such as oaks, ashes and hickories
- These will be more susceptible to winter freeze which leads to later leaf-out. 
==However, there are a lot of exceptions to these rules.==
