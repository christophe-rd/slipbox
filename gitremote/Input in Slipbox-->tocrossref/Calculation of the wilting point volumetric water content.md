**Relevant notes**:
- Permanent wilting point VWC (VWC at which soil matric potential is -1500kPa).  
- 0rel (difference between VWC (of any replicat) - VWC at PWP)
- So, +0rel values corresponds to conditions at which soil water can be taken up by roots, and - is where soil water is not extractable by plants
