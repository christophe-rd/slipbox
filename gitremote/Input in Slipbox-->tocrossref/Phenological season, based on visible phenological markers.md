#### **Relevant notes**:
We refer to the phenological season, when referring to a timeframe based on phenological observations, rather than growth. Altough there is a contrast between :
- Invisible developmental stages and processes (metabolism, hormones)
- Visible changes in appearance ([[Phenology]])
*** this contrast complicates the definitions on the onset and end of the phenological season

**Summary** : the growing season associated with the period from the beginning to the end of visible phenostages (e.g. budbreak or leaf coloration).
- Doesn't account for actual growth 
- Not precise regarding phenology markers
- Visible phenostages do not always fit the plant-internal progression in development.
