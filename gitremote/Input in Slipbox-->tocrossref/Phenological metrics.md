#### **Definition**: 
Phenological metrics aka phenometrics are ecologically-meaningful metrics based on functional analysis from satellite-derived vegetation indices (or satellite-derived biophysical variables). These include the start of the growing season (SOS), the end of the growing season (EOS) and the length of the growing season, which could be considered as a proxy of timing of phenophases.
