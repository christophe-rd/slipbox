#### **Relevant notes**:
- The more time plants are exposed to cool temperatures, the less energy is required for the buds to burst
- In the context of extended heat period, frost damage trees a lot. That phenomenon follows an elevation gradient. Also birch have shown a reduction of radio growth in the presence of a spring frost. [[Radial growth response to defoliation]]
	- They don't show a carry-over in the following years.
	- There seems to be a compromise: they reduce radial growth instead of reduction of non structural carbohydrates
- Trees have shown a delay of #leaf_senescence  in response to spring frost
- The phenological stage that's most sensible to frost: leaf out
	- Mature leaves are more tolerant
- There are costs of additional #leaf_cohort due to spring frost
- Thorough description of #phenostages
- Species that flush earlier have an advantage in terms of light. Predominantly for shade-intolerant species.

**Questions**
- Why birch don't show a carry-over after a spring frost year?
	- Answer:

**Unknown words**: 
- Forcing: as opposed to chilling, so it's when temperature increases.

**[Ideas]**
- Expand knowledge of species-specific responses to frost. It appears like there is a lack of data in the litterature regarding this.
