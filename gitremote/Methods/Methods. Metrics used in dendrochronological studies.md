#### **Relevant notes**:
- **Tree-ring width** measures the thickness of a  single year's growth ring. This can vary depending on tree species, environmental conditions, and other factors.
- **Basal area** is the cross-sectional area of the trunk at a specific height, usually 
  expressed in square centimeters or square meters. It is calculated as:
- **Basal Area Increment** quantifies the change in basal area from one year to the next. This allows researchers to assess how much growth the tree adds annually in terms of trunk cross-section, not just linear growth. It reflects the tree's overall volume or biomass 
  accumulation more accurately than ring width alone

Radial growth represents actual, integrated measures of tree and stand wood production. Studies of this characteristic over long periods of time increase the reliability of modelling efforts and conclusions. They showed that the southern seed sources could out-perform local populations in diameter and height growth. Southern seed sources might be better adapted to warming temperatures.
