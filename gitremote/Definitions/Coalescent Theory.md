#### **Definition**: 
**Coalescent theory** is a [model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling "Scientific modelling") of how [alleles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele "Allele") sampled from a [population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population "Population") may have originated from a [common ancestor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Most_recent_common_ancestor "Most recent common ancestor"). In the simplest case, coalescent [theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory "Theory") assumes no [recombination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_recombination "Genetic recombination"), no [natural selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection "Natural selection"), and no [gene flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_flow "Gene flow") or [population structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_structure_\(genetics\) "Population structure (genetics)"), meaning that each variant is equally likely to have been passed from one generation to the next.
