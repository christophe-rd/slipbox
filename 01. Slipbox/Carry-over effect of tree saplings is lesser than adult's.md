#### **Relevant notes**:
Even though sapling phenology doesn't represent adult tree phenology, they are relevant as they are the future of the next generation in mature forests. Thus the carryover effect for these might not be as strong as for adults because they have other factors such as flowering and seed formation that may play a regulating role.
