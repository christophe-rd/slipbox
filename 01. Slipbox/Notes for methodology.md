- Wrong location given in article, the one they game is in south east africa, where its supposed to be closed to lisbon

- [ ] Mention jittering
- [ ] Check Lizzie and the papers she took in her mapxt R code. ðŸ”¼ 
Hi! I would like to mention a few things before I finalize everything! 

1. From the review papers, I extracted articles that you already selected previously during the summer. From the script I created for the choropleth map, I deleted duplicated titles. Therefore, I believe there are 91 articles shown on the map instead of 95, although I might be wrong! This would also slightly change the average of scion and rootstocks. In my comments on the ms PDF, I wrote what I believe to me the most recent values.
2. I would like to note that when there was no mention of the number of rootstocks used in an article, the value shown in the interactive map is NA. Also, since the dot size fits the number of rootstocks used in the study, I replaced the 0s by 0,1s in order for them to appear on the map!
3. Also, some articles have exactly the same coordinates which makes it hard to distinguish since they are on the same dot. However, they appear by moving around the dot. Do you think I should just slightly change the coordinates to facilitate readability?
4. I adjusted the jittering from 50 to 10, as some locations didn't make sense (some were in the ocean!).
5. I sent the html to Tolu and asked her to create a web page.
6. [Here's the static version](https://github.com/lizzieinvancouver/asevdiversitydup/blob/97fc64e7367dcf3f525303a49067c7d9cb495544/figures/static_version.pdf) -- I might need to do a few updates tomorrow.
