Discussing tree rings imaging!
Steps to get tree rings :
1. Belt sand the cookies.
2. Hand sand them to grain needed. Finer if I want to see cell levels
3. Input in software. Should take about 5 minutes per angle. Need to do multiple angles per cookie. Mao says I can do cross dating at the same time. 

Discuss with Lizzie:
1. Plan for belt sanding?
2. Cell level?
3. Storage? Hard drive or cloud
4. Safety training for belt sanding

- For image J, maybe print 1 picture with 3 lines. 
- How to add years directly? 
- Can we add comments to measurements in image J
- Leave trace?

Ask Neil on standard protocols for sharing images. Should they have a appendix. Repos where they are shared and stored?
