#### **Relevant notes**:
Ecologists use time to describe the suite of critical but limited resources available to a species at any given time. Variability in space and time may promote coexistence. 
- E.g. Ant species with highly similar diets may coexist because they tend to search for food at different times of the day. 
At a longer time scale, the **storage effect model** uses a [[Temporal Niche|temporal niche]] to promote coexistence via inter-annual variation that benefits different "long-lived" species in different years. Under this model, a species can coexist with other species when it experiences high-abundance years during which intraspecific competition is stronger than interspecific competition.
