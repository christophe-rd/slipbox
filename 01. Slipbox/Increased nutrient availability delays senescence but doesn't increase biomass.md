#### **Relevant notes**:
Increased nutrient availability was found to delay leaf senescence in Populus trichocarpa. Therefore, senescence appears to be largely driven by the interaction between nutrients, particularly nitrogen and carbon supply. 
- High nutrients will therefore allow trees to maintain source activity (photosynthesis) for a longer time and shed their leaves later. 

However, no biomass increment was found in their experiment for the fertilized treatments.
