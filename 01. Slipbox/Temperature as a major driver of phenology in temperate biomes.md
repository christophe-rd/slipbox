#### **Relevant notes**:
In temperate biomes, when precipitation is regular throughout the year, temperature is expected to be a major driver of phenology, especially at the start and end of the GS. 
However, when climate variability is low and competition between plants for soil, light and pollinator resources is high, biotic forces should dominate and shape selection. 
Note: In arid and semi-arid systems, moisture is a critical drive of phenology
