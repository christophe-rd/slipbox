#### **Relevant notes**:
When competing for light and water, rapid height growth seems advantageous in warmer climates, whereas populations in cold climates are typically more open and have evolved under natural selection for greater overall robustness, including cold hardiness. However, the trade-off between growth allocation and physiological adaptations to cold conditions remains unclear. Indeed, the lower biomass increment observed in populations originating from colder environments when planted in common gardens could result from these populations ceasing to grow under shorter photoperiods.
