#### **Relevant notes**:
Early season warming, causing earlier spring leaf-out and faster growth and tissue maturation tends to advance EOS dates. Late season warming has the opposite effect i.e. delaying EOS. 

Increased temperatures and physiological early in the season might drive earlier leaf senescence through a variety of mechanisms including:
- Developmental and nutrient constraints
- Seasonal buildup of water stress and radiation induced leaf aging.

In contrast, later in the season, a direct effect of temperature is likely to drive the timing of leaf senescence. If both are correct, then climate warming has opposing effects at the start and end of the growing season with a reversal of effects somewhere in between.
