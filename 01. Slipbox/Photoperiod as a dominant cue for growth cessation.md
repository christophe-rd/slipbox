#### **Relevant notes**:
There is considerable evidence that **photoperiod** is the dominant cue for growth cessation and bud set in many temperate and boreal trees. Temperature has been shown to impact these processes in some species. 
Bud set represents a major shift in developmental pathways that starts the process of dormancy induction prior to winter.

Photoperiodic control of growth cessation and bud set comes from provenance trials. 
- E.g. balsam poplar populations have showed important divergence in bud set when grown in a common garden. This suggests strong selection for this phenological trait (neutral processes).
Phenotypic variance in budset is strongly related to provenance, with northen populations setting bud earlier than southern ones, consistent with the role of photoperiod as a major control on bud set.
