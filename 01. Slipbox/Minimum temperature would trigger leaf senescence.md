#### **Relevant notes**:
Daily minimum temperature (model [[Daily minimum temperature model (TPM)|TPM]]) would be important for leaf senescence rather than mean daily temperature. 
- Based on the evidence minimum temperature may trigger leaf senescence by decreasing light-saturated photosynthetic rate and limiting meristematic activity in shoot. 
- For the latter, as leaf senescence should be intimately related to the previous developmental stages of leaf, such as leaf initiation, growth, and maturation, it is possible that genes controlling these processes, including meristematic activity, could influence age-dependent senescence.
