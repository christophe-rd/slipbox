#### **Relevant notes**:
- From a 30-year observation in Europe they have found that :
	- Leaf unfolding has advanced by 6 days
	- Leaf colouring has been delayed by 4.8 days
	- = Growing season has lengthened by 10.8 days since the 1960s. These changes can be attributed to air temperature
According to their model, 70% of inter-annual variability in **bud-break** is explained by **daily temperatures**. 
- Spring events will advance by 6 days/1Celsius increase in winter temperatures.
Therefore, the growing season is usually defined as the leaf unfolding and leaf colouring ([[Leaf unfolding and leaf colouration can act as a link between climate change and biogeochemical cycles]])
