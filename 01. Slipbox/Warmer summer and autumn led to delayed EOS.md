#### **Relevant notes**:
They found that a warming climate in summer/autumn delayed EOS date in most of Northern hemisphere, especially in cold region. 
This positive effect is likely related to the warming-induced enhancement of: 
- [[Delayed autumn senescence could be the result of maintained enzyme activity|Activities of photosynthetic enzymes]]
- Reduced speed of chlorophyll degradation
- Reduced probability of bering exposed to frost in autumn
- Increased potential for growth and photosynthetic consumption.
