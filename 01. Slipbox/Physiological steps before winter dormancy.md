#### **Relevant notes**:
###### Step 1: 
Cessation of growth in the middle of the active season in species with free growth to avoid the presence of active tissues (inadequate for overwintering.)
###### Step 2: 
Bud set which protects meristems with bud scales.
- These are morphological changes, but biochemical changes also occur at the cellular level, such as starch catabolism for supplying C skeletons for the synthesis of cryoprotectants or the accumulation of bark storage proteins. At this stage, plants have acquired [[Endodormancy|endodormancy]] and do not respond to signals that promote growth.Â 
###### Step 3:
Leaf senescence occurs near the end of this succession of events leading to the dormant stage, but later cellular changes can still occur to further increase frost hardiness.

Preparation for winter dormancy is mostly triggered by photoperiod. Moving plants to shorter days elicits growth cessation and bud set.
