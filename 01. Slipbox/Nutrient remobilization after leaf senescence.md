#### **Relevant notes**:
By the end of the process of leaf senescence, a large fraction of the mobile nutrients have been [[Where are nutrients stored during winter dormancy?|transferred to the perennating organs]]. 
Leaf senescence proceeds sequentially, it begins with the disassembly of the chloroplast, while [[Why mitochondria retain integrity during leaf senescence|mitochondria]] and nuclei remain functional.
Nutrient-containing macromolecules are degraded and transformed into molecules suitable for transport from the leaf.
