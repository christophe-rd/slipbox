#### **Relevant notes**:
Climate change has greatly shifted major events. E.g. spring and autumn, but has also caused phenological mismatch accross trophic levels. This can have strong impacts on community structures and ecosystem functions.
- E.g. different phenological responses to warming between [[Plant and bird phenology may be decoupled because of CC|plants and birds]] can make them breed at a time when the food isn't at its maximum supply
- E.g. it can also cause a reduction in seed production for some tree species.
