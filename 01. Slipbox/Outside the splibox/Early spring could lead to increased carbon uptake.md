#### **Relevant notes**:
We know that early spring and delayed autumn have been linked to increases in:
- Plant productivity
- Ecosystem carbon uptake
This study underlines that little is known about the partitioning between above and below-ground biomass.

**A prediction: 1 day of advanced leaf out = 45kg carbon/ha.**
