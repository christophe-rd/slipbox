#### **Relevant notes**:
They showed a lack of relationship between spring unfolding and latitude. This may have been because the response of spring phenology to photoperiod can be associated with a lot of confounding factors:
- Tree age
- Successional niche
- Xylem anatomy
- Chilling conditions.
Therefore, they couldn't conclude that photoperiod did not influence leaf unfolding, but how it might directly or indirectly affect spring phenology still remains unclear and is currently under debate.

*More details: Change in the relationship between chilling accumulation and heat requirement due to shortening days as warming advances leaf unfolding. However, they didn't observe changes in leaf unfolding with latitude neither across species nor individual species, as one could experct if photoperiod was a strong co-limitation of leaf unfolding.*
