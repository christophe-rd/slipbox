#### **Relevant notes**:
**A prediction: 1 day of delayed leaf senescence = 98kg carbon/ha.** 
However, delayed leaf senescence doesn't necessarily translate to increased plant productivity. Warmer spring and summer can also lead to **earlier growth cessation**.
- Perhaps here: [[Warmer springs lead to earlier tree phenology]] *Fredi mentions that earlier spring means plants start taking up water earlier and could increase drought. Therefore, this could partially explain the earlier growth cessation*
