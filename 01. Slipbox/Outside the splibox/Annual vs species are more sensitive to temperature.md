#### **Relevant notes**:
**Annual** species are generally more sensitive to temperature than **perennial** species and early ontogenic stages (e.g. seedlings) seem to be more sensitive than adults. 
This might show a **tradeoff** between investment/risk where individuals with lower investments appear more responsive to temperature compared with individuals with more investments.
**High risk:** high reward. More responsive organisms are subjected to greater risks, but also greater benefits. These will also tend to have increased abundance or fitness with increased temperature.
