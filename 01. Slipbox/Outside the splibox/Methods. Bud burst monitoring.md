#### **Relevant notes**:
Spring phenology was assessed by repeated observations of all seedlings. BB and leaf emergence were assessed for each inviduals as expressed as a single composite score for the tree. A scale from 1 (no bud activity) to 6 (leaves flat and expanded) was used, adapted from the phenological stages of Norby and al. 2003.
