#### **Relevant notes**:
There is growing evidence that climate change could facilitate invasions because of the distinct phenology or phenological sensitivity of [[Non-native species|non-native]] species. The theory of "Windows of invasion opportunity" may play a critical role in invasions. The concept of [[Temporal Niche|temporal niche]] in which time is a fundamental axis by which species may partition resource use, reduce interspecific competition and thus **promote coexistence**. 

Distinct phenologies may result in a **competitive** **advantage for non-native species**, especially in areas with shifting growing seasons due to climate change. If native species do not accurately and rapidly track shifting climate, it might produce vacant niches. Such vacant niches may then promote invader success by :
1. Directly i.e. an invader occupies the open niche space
2. Early-season priority effects
3. Invader plasticity where non-native species track climate shifts more closely than native speciesÂ 
4. Greater niche breadth (width)
Several studies have found that especially early or late phenologies may aid the success of non-native species
