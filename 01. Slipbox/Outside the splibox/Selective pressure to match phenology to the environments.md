#### **Relevant notes**:
Species are under continuous selective pressure to match their phenologies to favourable environmental conditions and positive biotic interactions to reduce fitness costs associated with mistiming. The costs of mistimed phenology associated with abiotic drives should be high. 
- E.g. blooming too early or late can lead to death or extensive tissue loss due to frost or drought in semi-arid systems.

Costs associated with biotic drivers may be lower over short-time scales. 
- E.g. Species that flower during the growing season but at the wrong period may face increased competition for soil resources or reduced pollination. This may reduce growth or reproductive output.
