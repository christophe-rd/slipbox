#### **Definition**:
Delpierre suggested a cold-degree day sum. (CDD) model which assusmes that leaf coloration is solely determined by the linear accumulation of daily mean temperature lower than a threshold. Its accuracy hasn't been tested. 
He revised his model by suggesting that **leaf colouration** is **driven both by photoperiod** and low temperature. 
Then, Delpierre et al. (2009b) postulated that leaf coloration is driven by both **photoperiod** and **low temperatures** and revised the CDD model by means of a photoperiod-sensitive cold-degree day summation procedure (termed the DM model).
