#### **Relevant notes**:
They found that the induced delay or advance of budburst had a strong impact on the timing of budset, used here as a proxy for primary growth cessation.
They suggest that the potential delay in senescence processes due to global warming might be smaller than expected because of this positive relationship between spring budburst timing and autumn phenophases.
