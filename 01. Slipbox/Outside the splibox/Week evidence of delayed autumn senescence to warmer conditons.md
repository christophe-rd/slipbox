#### **Relevant notes**:
Few studies have documented the phenological events in the fall. The evidence points toward a delaying trend, but this is much weaker than in the spring. 

***Thought**: could that weaker trend be caused by the fact that autumn phenological events are not as "clear cut as the spring's?*
