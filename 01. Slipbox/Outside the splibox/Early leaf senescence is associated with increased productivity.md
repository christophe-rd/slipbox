#### **Relevant notes**:
A strong relationship between observed EOS and simulated Anet (Net CO2 assimilation), such that **greater productivity was associated with earlier leaf senescence**. This negative relationship between growing-season total net CO2 assimilation and EOS was interpreted as an expression of **plant C sink saturation**, where an early replenishment of non-structural carbon reserves induces an early cessation of the photosynthetically active season.
