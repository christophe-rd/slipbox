#### **Relevant notes**:
**Vacant niche**: predicts that exotic plants will invade communities where there is an open niche, often resulting from unused soil resources. For plants, this theory has been modified to include **fluctuating resources**; in such cases, a vacant niche can be temporally variable, occurring only for a short period, but still highly beneficial to exotic species. If an exotic plant species benefit from a temporally vacant (phenological) niche, it would tend to bloom and or leaf earlier or later as compared with native plant species, thereby using temporally available resources (e.g. sunlight, pollinators, nutrients.)
