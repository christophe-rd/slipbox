#### **Relevant notes**:
- Climate change modifies tree communities in different ways, one of them is through an increase in tree mortality. This can be ascribed to drought or even insect epidemics that are induced by drought. 
	1. These insect epidemics increase defoliation, which often comes with a reduction of non-structural carbohydrates (NSC). Indeed, any way that defoliation occurs, can cause an imbalance in NSC concentrations. However, the severity of the defoliation varies regarding of:
		1. Host species
		2. Growth stage
		3. Nitrogen content
		4. Young leaves expansion rate.
