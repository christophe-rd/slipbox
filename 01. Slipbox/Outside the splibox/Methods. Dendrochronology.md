#### **Relevant notes**:
At the start of the research project, there is a search phase. At this stage, the optimum information should be obtained with the least effort. The first features of the core that are easy to identify are:
- Mean ring width
- Sensitivity (i.e. frequency of visually recognizable signatures or pointer years)
- Frequency and date of abrupt changes in ring width
- Rot, wounds, compression wood.
Definition of dendroecology: determination of the year-by-year interplay of relationships among climate, site conditions, and tree growth to assess exogenous and endogenous factors that influence the growth of a plant community

Once the surface is prepared, it may be cross-dated first or measured first, then cross-dated using the measured ring width
Simple orbital or rotary sanding tools using a range of grit size from 280 to 600 are satisfactory. Don't overheat the wood and wear mask as the dust from hardwood is linked with cancer.
