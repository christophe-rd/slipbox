#### **Relevant notes**:
While temperature has been shown to beÂ an important driver of autumn leaf senescence, carbon source-sink dynamics have been proposed as a mechanism that could help explain the variation of this important process. According to the carbon sink limitation hypothesis, senescence is regulated by the interplay between plant carbon source and sink dynamics, so senescence occurs later upon low carbon inputs (**source**) and earlier upon low carbon demand (**sink**).

The concept of carbon sink limitation in trees is supported by a study that demonstrated that individuals that leafed out and senesced earlier had high levels of non-structural carbohydrates (NSC)
