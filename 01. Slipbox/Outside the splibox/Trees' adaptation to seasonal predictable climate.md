#### **Relevant notes**:
Trees have evolved, in the last 11 000 years into an interglacial period (Holocene), which is warmer than the preceding 100 000 years i.e. the last glacial period. 
- This period is climatically stable when viewed from a geological time perspective. 
- However, the climate of temperate areas is highly variable from the perspective of trees' lifespan, but with a **predictable seasonality**. Â As a result, trees have evolved to cope with the seasonal occurrence of freezing temperatures. One of the adaptations to seasonality is cold acclimatation in autumn and dormancy in winter, followed by a [[Trees go through 2 forms of deacclimatation during spring|deacclimatation]] period in spring. These are mediated by temperature and photoperiod.
