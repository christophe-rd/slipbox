#### **Relevant notes**:
Photoperiod is often accepted as a trigger of autumn phenology. However, **potential warming at the end of the growing season** is often ignored. 
Yet, inter-annual differences in autumn phenology beg an explanation. 
Autumn **temperatures** were the primary cue for senescence in 2 Quercus species. 
Same for Fagus, but photoperiod played a role as well.
In Populus, senescence was triggered by long nights, but lower temperature accelerated chlorophyll degradation. 
Malus and Pyrus, senescence was induced by low temperature and they were **insensitive** to photoperiod. 
Their results show delayed phenophases regardless of differences in photoperiod between source and field sites. Delays in leaf abscission were more pronounced than delays in chlorophyll loss.
