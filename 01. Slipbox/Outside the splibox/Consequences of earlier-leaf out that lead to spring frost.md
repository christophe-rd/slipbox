#### **Relevant notes**:
Earlier leaf-out increases the risk of spring frost
- **E.g. in 2007 Eastern North America:**
	- There was a warm spell in March --> leaf-out. 
	- Subsequent freezing temperatures in early April caused the young leaves and flowers of woody plants to suffer from frost damage.
	- Immediate result: dieback of young growth. 
	- The damage differed among species depending on the individual developmental stage. 
		- Plants undergoing leaf elongation suffered much more than those that were just bud bursting their buds. 
		- Species that burst their leaf buds early and developed slowly were less vulnerable to the late frost than plants with early budburst and quick leaf development. 
		- Species with late budbursts and quick development of leaves also suffered high damage.
