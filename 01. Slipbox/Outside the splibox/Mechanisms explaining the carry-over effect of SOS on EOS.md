#### **Relevant notes**:
Mechanisms proposed to explain the carryover effects of SOS on EOS (i.e. earlier start of season is followed by an earlier date of EOS):
1. Timing of leaf senescence was reported to be constrained by factors associated with leaf traits directly, such as leaf life span and programmed cell death.
2. Earlier spring might lead to soil water loss in the early part of growing season, thereby increasing the prevalence of [[Earlier leaf-out might amplify drought in early summer|drought during summer]] --> result in early leaf senescence
3. Earlier leaf emergence may [[Earlier-leaf out can lead to spring frost|increase the risk of being exposed to spring frost ]]and the **oubreak of harmful insects** which may be related to earlier leaf sencesnce.
4. [[Carbon source-sink dynamics could influence leaf senescence|Correlation between SOS and EOS may be related to the limitation in the size of the plants' carbon sink]]: earlier accumulation of nonstructural carbohydrate in spring might have contributed to the earlier achievement of its max carbon content in autumn
