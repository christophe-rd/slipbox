#### **Relevant notes**:
Manipulative experiments are a useful tool because it's difficult to reveal the covarying drivers of phenology and gain insights in the mechanisms that drive the patterns in the observations and changes by using solely phenology observations. 
**Cons**:
1. Most experiments use only a few species and last for few years.
	1. This short-term may not suffice to induce adaptive responses or to gain a complete understanding of long-term phenoresponses of plants to environmental changes. Other ecological processes play an increasing role over time. E.g. nutrient availability and thermal acclimation. 
2. Only conducted on saplings/seedlings and rarely on mature trees. They can show very different responses to the same environmental changes. 
3. Pheno responses to experimental and natural conditions may differ a lot. 
**Pros**: advantage of keeping certain conditions constant, so they are ideal to answer hypothesis testing.
