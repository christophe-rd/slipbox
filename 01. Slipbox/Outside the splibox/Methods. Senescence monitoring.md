#### **Relevant notes**:
They collected leaf litter from the growth chambers at 5 to 18 days intervals. 
They measured chlorophyll in individual trees, based on a pre-selected subsample of leaves and supplemented by a random sampling of leaves in the crown. 
Fallen leaves were recorded as 0 color. 
Populus: didn't make estimates as there was too much biotic damage. 
They used SPAD-502 to measure chlorophyll
Unitless SPAD values were converted to chlorophyll concentrations using a calibration established from a subsample of leaves of each species.
