#### **Relevant notes**:
The start of the thermal growing season directly influences plant phenology and its advance matches the inter-annual variability of spring green-up. These phenoshifts influence the capacity of the biosphere top take up carbon and they affect the exchange of energy between the atmosphere and the biosphere.
However, we don't know if these shifts in plant phenology would result in a negative feedback to warming and an increased carbon uptake or alternatively, exhibit additional ecological stress.
