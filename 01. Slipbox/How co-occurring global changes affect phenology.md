#### **Relevant notes**:
Most phenological advancing studies have attributed the acceleration of spring events to warming temperatures. Less attention has focused on the role of other co-occurring global changes such as increasing CO2 and shifts in precipitation.
- E.g. crop species respond to elevated CO2 more than wild species for several reproductive traits such as flowering. This might be because their growth isn't limited by other resources such as nutrients, water and light.

Temporal dispersion (or complementarity) in phenology is an important factor promoting co-existence among species in plant communities. It can also influence ecosystem processes such as nutrient capture and productivity. 2 experiments show that species-level shifts in phenology resulted in altered community interactions.
