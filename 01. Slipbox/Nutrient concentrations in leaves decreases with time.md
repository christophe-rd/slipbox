#### **Relevant notes**:
Leaves that fell early contained more nutrients and the nutrient concentrations decreased linearly with time to match the lower concentrations in the leaves that fell later.
**Nutrient resorption takes time.** 
- E.g. P. tremula takes two weeks. 
They hypothesize that with warming, a slower, thus longer leaf senescence can allow a more thorough scouring of nutrients so the realized resorption can approach the potential resorption.

Species whose leaf senescence will be delayed by warming will confront higher risks of occasional reductions in nutrient proficiency because warming increases the risk that early frosts will kill the leaves before they complete or even begin senescence.
