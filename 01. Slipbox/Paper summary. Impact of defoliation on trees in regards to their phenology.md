**Relevant notes**:
1. Climate change modifies tree communities in different ways, one of them is through an increase in tree mortality. This can be ascribed to drought or even insect epidemics that are induced by drought. 
	1. These insect epidemics increase defoliation, which often comes with a reduction of non-structural carbohydrates (NSC). Indeed, any way that defoliation occurs, can cause an imbalance in NSC concentrations. However, the severity of the defoliation varies regarding of:
		1. Host species
		2. Growth stage
		3. Nitrogen content
		4. Young leaves expansion rate. 
2. It is unknown whether phenology dependant variations in NSC concentrations have an impact on insect predation.
	1. Phenological asynchrony might function as a good mechanism by which plants protect themselves from insects. 
		1. *This is just a hypothesis, it has not been verified.*
3. Relation between defoliation and NSC concentrations:
	1. Carbohydrates reserves play a critical role in tree survival under stress.
	2. Herbivory may amplify or be amplified by carbon starvation
		1. Declining carbohydrate reserves could cause hydraulic failure because the plant's is unable to refill [[Embolized conduits]]
			1. This increases the plant's vulnerability to water deficit.
	3. Second cohort leaves consumes a lot of NSC reserves. 
		1. If leaves are immediately consumed by pests --> might cause carbon starvation --> hydraulic failure
4. They show that the leaf renewal process consumes a significant amount of NSC reserves, while the other doesn't
	1. It's explained by the NSC concentrations that show a great variation depending on phenological events. 
5. According to the [[Carbon Starvation Hypothesis]], the plants should have shown an imbalance between the carbon uptake and expense during long-term external stress.
	1. This was significant for one species, but not the other. 
6. Defoliation slows the rate of tree growth including woody tissues and branch size
	1. *I should read those articles*: [[To read]] 
7. There was an increase in [[Huber value]] suggesting an decrease in the total leaf area
8. Trees infested show a reduction of radial growth during pest outbreaks and also in the following years.
