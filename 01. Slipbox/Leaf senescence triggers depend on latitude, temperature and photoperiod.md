#### **Relevant notes**:
Their results show that leaf senescence processes were mainly triggered by photoperiod shortening at locations with shorter annual maximum photoperiod but by night temperature decrease at locations with longer annual maximum photoperiod. This supports the fact that there are two distinctive growth cessation pathways for woody plants:
1. Low night temperature-induced growth cessation under long photoperiods
2. Short photoperiod-induced growth cessation under warm night temperatures.
Both pathways reflect plant-selective responses to environmental cues for minimizing risk from abiotic stresses.
