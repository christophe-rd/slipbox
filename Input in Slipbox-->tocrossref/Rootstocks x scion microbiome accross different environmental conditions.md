#### **Relevant notes**:
Recuitment and assembly of a plant microbiome is affected by :
1. The plant species (since it determins the microbial recruitment from the soil to the root)
2. Scion and rootstock since they impact the physiology, morphology and biochemistry of the grafted plant. 
They studied bacterial and fungi communities accross **7 rootstock x scion combinations** and accross **10 vineyards**.
