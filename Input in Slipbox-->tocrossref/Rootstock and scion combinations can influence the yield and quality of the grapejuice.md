#### **Relevant notes**:
Studies have shown contradictory results regarding the consquences of rootstock and scion interactions on grapejuice yield and quality.
- Ferree et al. 1996 found no significant scion x rootstock interactions for cluster and fruit quality
- [Rives, 1971](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/235694077.pdf) showed that different scion varieties may require different rootstocks to optimise performance
	- Rootstock can be selected to modulate overall vine vigour and performance. 

There is a lack of data on genotype (rootstock x scion) x environment or rootstock x scion interactions. Some have studied this, but with few rootstocks:
- [Habran et al . (2016)](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2016.01134/full)
- Ough et al (1969) : I dougt that they actually studied it. 
- [Wooldridge et al . (2010)](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/0e86/5f9e24893a3f54b2bf3ca8ce89e369bf471e.pdf) : mostly during different years, not in different spots.
