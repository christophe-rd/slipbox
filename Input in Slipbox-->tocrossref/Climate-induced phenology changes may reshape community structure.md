#### **Relevant notes**:
The wide range of plant phenoresponses to climate change might cause community structure to be reshaped.
- E.g. a study showed that species growing in a cool climate are more sensitive to warming climate than those in warm regions. 
Convergence of phenological events across a temperature gradient could also increase gene flow across lat/long. 

It can also cause [[Phenological mismatch across trophic levels because of climate change]], by altering for example the interactions between plants and herbivores. 

Plant phenological shifts can also alter soil moisture, run-off and precipitation through their influence on evapotranspiration.

Finally, [[Plant phenological changes can modify surface temperature]].
