**Relevant notes**:
- Timing of defoliation affects how trees allocate carbon to growth and storage. There are also differences between species. E.g. oaks produce only a single flush of leaves and shoot growth, in opposition to other trees with indeterminate growth that can refoliate more effectively.

In this meeting: [[Shoot elongation scrum meeting]] we talked about shoot elongation, which is linked with determinate and indeterminate growth.
