**Relevant notes**:
According to the [[Carbon Starvation Hypothesis]], the plants should have shown an imbalance between the carbon uptake and expense during long-term external stress.
	1. This was significant for one species, but not the other. 

**Question**: What kind of long term stress could cause such an imbalance
