#### **Definition**: 
Phenology refers to the transition accross different physiological states on a **seasonal** dimension. It's opposed to [[Ontogeny]].

Phenology  includes:
- Internal signal to prepare the orgnism for growth
- Advances of phenophases (controlled by DNA, and mediated by hormones, followed by activating and building meristematic tissues)
	- E.g. of a phenophase: 
		- Vegetative apical meristem that switches to a reproductive meristem. *This a a developmental transition*
