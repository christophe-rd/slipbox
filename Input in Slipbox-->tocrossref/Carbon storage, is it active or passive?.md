**Relevant notes**:
1. Definitions:
	- Passive: growth would be carbon limited --> no NSC accumulation
		- Storage would form an excess pool when carbon supply > demand of other processes.
	- Active: [[Carbon storage]] would be an active process when carbon is directed into storage in the expense of growth
		- i.e. plants invest more in storage and less in growth.
2. The notion of compromise: trees might have evolved to store carbon, in the expense of growth to avoid carbon-limited conditions (aka [[Carbon Starvation]]) --> not as a result of sink limitation
	1. The investment of carbon in growth is an active response either plastic or evolutionary, to reduce the risk of starvation
