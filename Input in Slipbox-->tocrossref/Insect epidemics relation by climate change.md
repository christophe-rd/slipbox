**Relevant notes**:
Insect epidemics increase defoliation, which often comes with a reduction of non-structural carbohydrates (NSC). Indeed, any way that defoliation occurs, can cause an imbalance in NSC concentrations. However, the severity of the defoliation varies regarding of:
		1. Host species
		2. Growth stage
		3. Nitrogen content
		4. Young leaves expansion rate.
