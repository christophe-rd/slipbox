#### **Relevant notes**:
- Temperature has an impact on annual tree growth in two ways
	1. It modifies the season length, thus the seasonal preparedness for growth
		-  This is driven by developmental stages tied to a combination of :
			- Internal clock
			- Photoperiod
			- Thermal history (including chilling and water availability)
	2. Direct action of temperature on cell production once trees are released from dormancy
		- Temperature instantaneously impacts meristems.
		- BUT on a mechanistic basis, it's not influenced by the **mean** temperature (a mean isotherm)
- Cold-adapted plant species have a growth rate of 0 at 0 °C.
	- The response is asymptotic --> Growth rates are very slow below 5-7 °C, at which it hardly contributes to growth.
