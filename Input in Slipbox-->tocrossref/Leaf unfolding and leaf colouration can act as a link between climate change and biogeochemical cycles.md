#### **Relevant notes**:
They define the growing season as the **leaf unfolding** date in spring to the **leaf colouration** in autumn (*here, Korner proposes different definitions of plant's growing seasons: [[Plant's growing season traditional definition leads to confused consequences and implications]]*). 
These two events can act as a link between climate change and biogeochemical cycles. 

Shifts in the growing season may influence the exchange capacities of carbon, water and energy among lang surfaces and the atmosphere. This could lead to ecosystem productivity variations. This will in turn affect the global carbon balance and climate change.
