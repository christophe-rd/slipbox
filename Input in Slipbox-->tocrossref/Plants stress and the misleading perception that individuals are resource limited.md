#### **Relevant notes**:
The assumption that individuals are resource limited is missleading. It's based on an agronomic perception because it's focused on the biomass production. As an ecological concept, limitaion accounts for evolutionary fitness i.e. the reproductive performance of a plant relative to its neighbours (conspecific individuals OR other species). 
The term **optimum** is often ambivalent and doesn't account for a community. In contrast, [[Stress]] should not be defined as the absence of optimal growth conditions.
- If that was the definition, plants in the wild would be permanently stressed. 
###### E.g.  Semi-arid community: 
- Increase of water availability
- No additional taxa (transition period)
- As the time goes, there will be new species assemblage and :
	- Changes in the community
