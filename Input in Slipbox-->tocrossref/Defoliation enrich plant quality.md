#### **Relevant notes**:
- Defoliation in **evergreen** conifers might:
	- Increase foliar nitrogen
	- Decrease carbon storage --> because carbon is mostly stored in foliage
- Weak signs of induced defense after one year of chronic defoliation for P. Sylvestris has been observed
- Because Nitrogen increases in defoliated plants and because dry matter decreases, **chronically defoliated trees are a better food ressource**
- Plant defenses are constrained by proportions of a plant's carbon and nutrients
- **Summary**: defoliation enrich plant quality
