#### Relevant notes:
- At the end of the growing season, when [[Secondary growth]] and [[Primary growth]] cease, there is an imbalance between the production of carbohydrates (source) and their use for growth (sink)
	- During this period, leaves and other organs show a **faster accumulation of carbohydrates**.
		- This might downregulate #photosynthetic_genes and accelerate #leaf_senescence.
