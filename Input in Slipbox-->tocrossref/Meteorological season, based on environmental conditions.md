#### **Relevant notes**:
Meteorological growing season (aka [[Window of opportunity]]) refers to the period where environmental conditions coult theoretically allow growth.
- Context of climate change: spring and autumn warming leads to an extension of meteorological season (for extratropical regions)
	- However its effect on plant growth and development is ambigous
- An ealier start of growing season that are caused by warmer springs, have been shown to have no effect on annual increment. 
	- *i.e. even if season is longer, it doesn't mean there's an increase in annual increment*

This definition relies on an assumption that plant's activities are related to long-term climate. There is two drivers that control plant growth and development:
- Soil moisture availability
- Temperature
###### Limitation of this definition:
- Good conditions at the wrong time or extreme events during the assumed fabourable period  cannot be covered by this definiiton
	- E.g. **Spring frost** or **drought** can slow growth, phenology and productivity
	- These are difficult to predict on a long-term basis
		- ==**Therefore, a meteorological season is a potential season**==
		- Start and end of a meteorological season is often defined with mean temperatures, altough there mask a wide range of temperatures. 
			- **Means are the least suitable** : [[How tree growth is affected by temperature]]
