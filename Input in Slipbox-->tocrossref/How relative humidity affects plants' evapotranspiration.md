##### **Relevant notes**:
- The most important parameters to study evapotranspiration are :
	- Solar radiation
	- Temperature
	- Relative humidity
		- If the relative humidity (RH) is high, the plant can't transpire 
		- Therefore, if the RH is low, the plant will suck up water from the soil and transpire faster than at a high RH
