**Relevant notes**:
- Mature trees don't show a shortage of NSC during the growing season, even during periods of extensive fruit production
- Since mature trees were well supplied in carbon, atmospheric CO2 increases might not have an effect on C assimilation, as might be assumed based on photosynthetic characteristics alone.

- With the increase in atmospheric CO2, tree differences in their carbon assimilation phenology could lead to the choice of which trees to plant
