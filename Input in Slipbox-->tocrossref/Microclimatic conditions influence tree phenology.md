**Relevant notes**:
- Tree buds are subjected to a great variation in temperature and light conditions, as the ones 2 meters from the forest floor have less light and cooler temperatures than the ones at 30 meters. 
	- This underlines the importance of considering microclimatic conditions on plants phenology
- This study showed that microclimatic conditions, especially solar radiation regulates the timing of **bud burst in spring** and **leaf senescence in the Fall**.
