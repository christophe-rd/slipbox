It had been shown that a protective mechanisms that plants have to defend themselves from herbivores can either be done by a loss of interest (low positive nutritional nutrients) or by defense (phenols and resins at high concentration). 
Also, tannins and phenols are general indicators of defense levels.
Although, phenol contents may be doubtful, since some phenols are beneficial to some herbivores.
