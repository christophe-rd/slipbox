#### **Relevant notes**:
Beside Phylloxera epidemic that let to major genetic losses of Vitis vinifera subsp. vinifera, in Europe, habitat loss and fragmentation have also reduced populations of Vitis rupestris and some Vitis cinerea varieties. These two species are from North America and Asia. Also, North American species have also lost diversity through hybridization with vinifera. This is because species from Vitis genus are interbreadable. 

150 years ago, winegrape diversity threatened by phylloxera was saved by N-A Vitis species. Unfortunately, today's diversity might not be rich enough to face climate change's global threat. This include increasing drought and heat stress due to climate change, the rise of new pests or diseases. 

The link with terroir, that is defined by how the environnemental traits define the wine from a region, might be modified. This also emphasizes how much the environnement impacts the wine produced. The winegrape by environnement interaction is in the concept of terroir. It's also a concept in biology referred to as a genotype by environnement (G X E) interaction. It underlies why the same variety has different growing season length depending on the location at which it is plante
d. Winegrape have espacially high levels of such interactions. This complexity is multiplied bu the [chimeric] form of today's winegrapes: rootstock and scion.
