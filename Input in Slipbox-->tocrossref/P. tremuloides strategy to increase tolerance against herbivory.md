**Relevant notes**:
- A study has shown that  P. tremuloides that are defoliated allocate a lot of resources to the rapid growth of multiple shoots. It seems to be a strategy that this species has developed to increase tolerance against herbivory.
**Questions**
- At the first defoliation treatment, I noticed that prunus show refoliation faster than betula. Could prunus show indeterminate growth?

Timing of defoliation affects how trees allocate carbon to growth and storage. There are also differences between species. E.g. oaks produce only a single flush of leaves and shoot growth, in opposition to other trees with indeterminate growth that can refoliate more effectively.
