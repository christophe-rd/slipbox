#### **Relevant notes**:
We refer to the **productive season** for the period at which a plant exhibit a net carbon gain.

More specifically, it's the first and last passage of a minimum rate of biomass production/carbon gain. Different measures can be used to quantify this:
- Net biomass increase 
- Net primary production
- Net ecosystem exchange
- Net ecosystem production
