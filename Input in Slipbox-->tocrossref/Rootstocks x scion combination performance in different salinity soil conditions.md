#### **Relevant notes**:
- A difference in performance was observed between the rootstock x scion combinations, depending on the environement in which they were used. 
	- **This shows the importance of rootstock x scion x environement importance**.
- Altough, this study is on the impact of **salinity** on yield performance.
