**Relevant notes**:
Relation between defoliation and NSC concentrations:
	1. Carbohydrates reserves play a critical role in tree survival under stress.
	2. Herbivory may amplify or be amplified by carbon starvation
		1. Declining carbohydrate reserves could cause hydraulic failure because the plant's is unable to refill [[Embolized conduits]]
			1. This increases the plant's vulnerability to water deficit.
	3. Second cohort leaves consumes a lot of NSC reserves. 
		1. If leaves are immediately consumed by pests --> might cause carbon starvation --> hydraulic failure
	4. A new cohort of leaves consumes NSC: [[Cost of producing a new cohort of leaves after a defoliation event]]
