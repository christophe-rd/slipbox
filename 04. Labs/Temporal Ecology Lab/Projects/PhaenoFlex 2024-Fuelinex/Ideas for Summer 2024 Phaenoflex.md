- Defoliation, prior to budburst, by herbivory
- Simulate spring frost after budburst
	- Try to think the opposite way, what do i want to answer and how to achieve it. 
- Investigate if the different treatments have an impact on phenological events, the visible ones, and hormone concentrations, to show if internal control is affected by forcing
	- *I had this idea from reading this paper : [[Phenological season, based on visible phenological markers]]*


#### Notes of things to remember
- Measure weight and VWC, and try to predict the date at which the trees will reach their wilting point.
- Check the climate chambers:
	- If they work
	- If they are available
- Order enough soil
- Are the double pots reusable?
- Structure for charging the dendrometers to avoid moving them all the time. 
- Labels --> Freddi has the files

As nitrogen addition can delay flowering. It could be interesting to add to the experiment how nitrogen addition will affect phenophases.
