##### Discussing 3 Project Ideas
**1. Early vs. Late warming effects on current and next year’s growth performance**
Question: Would there be a possibility to keep some of this year's replicates from getting destroyed? No
LW: exciting, want to make sure colleagues arent doing the same thing. Full-time, drop irrigation, when they leaf out. Starting of GS: Control will be in cold climate chamber, Treatment will be in climate chamber warming, that will be in
End of growing season: control go in cooling. Warming will be in the warming chamber. (number 2 hidden activities)
Potential increasing biomass the following year: 2 methods (stable isotope compound in the nitrogen that I could track to different organs and second measure storage compounds)

**2. Hidden activities in autumn may influence next year's performance of temperate trees**
- The problem with a 2-year project?
- Are trees able to take up nutrients?
LW: exciting interest and by chance that plants do nothing: it's not exciting. High risk high reward. Do not do it as a sole experiment. 


Do research: boost nutrients got senescence early () It would be more interesting to do nutrients. Be careful about pot effect. Be really careful about this even for the small trees.  

**3. The gap between nutrient acquisition and nutrient utilization**
- This would include defoliation. Right before nutrient addition?
- Should it start in April? Will the leaves be out at this time of the year?
LW: not excited

**General concerns**:
- When should we order the trees?
- When should I arrive in Van --> as I'd rather not finish my bachelor's and start work right away?

To do:
- GitHub: on species and treatments. Write an email for the space for the greenhouse. New repo. 
- Design of the treatments that could be worth it.
- Number of replicates and species.
