Sorry for the (very) slow reply! I didn't clean systematically source.population. I only fixed them whenever I looked back at the papers and noticed there was a mistake in it! 

For the MS Foundation, to confirm, I should change the source.population name to “MS foundation” instead of “Multiple Sclerosis Foundation, Maracujá, Serrolandia, Bahia, Brazil”, even if that is how they state it in the methods? See bellow:

> The work was conducted at the Laboratory of Seed Analysis of the Center of Agricultural Sciences in the Federal University of Espírito Santo (Laboratório de Análise de Sementes do Centro de Ciências Agrárias da Universidade Federal do Espírito Santo), located in Alegre-ES, using Crambe abyssinica Hochst seeds from the 2009 (batch 1) and 2010 (batch 2) crops, obtained with the MS Foundation, located in Maracujá-MS. The seeds were stored in permeable paper bags in a refrigerator.

For the coordinates, they are currently related to the geographical location of Maracuja Brazil found on Google map. Should I leave it like this?


#### To do when I get wifi back
cuena-Lombrana18: search for location of Gennargentu Massif because the two sardaigna localities cannot be found. OK

zadeh15: Wait for dan on issue crop

check if the coordinates by 36. etc. would make sens and change if that's correct. OK
