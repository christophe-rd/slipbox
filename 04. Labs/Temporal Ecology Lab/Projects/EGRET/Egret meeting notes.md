For rows, that only have 5 lat long, look back in the pdf

Masting.
Ask around for masting data for maple syrup. 

For my coordinate cleaning task: I should check out the continents and color them to see if they match

#### 11 September 2024
**Issue 48:** @lizzie and check exactly what we want to do with the 2 additional dots. 

Whats up with Issue #33. Leave it opened for now, but we mostly decided 
##### For next meeting: 1
**Issue 47:** do a map for the warm strat treatment

### 25 September 2024
Things to adress: 
- Figures and .ai that we all need to git pull

Warm Strat: 
There are 3 different scripts that created columns:
1. scarificationcount.R by CRD:
	1. Greb warm in treatment column and only removed one entry.
	Comment: missing multiple places where warm strat can occur. 
2. dropextratreats.R by Dan
	1. Comment by Dan: Come back to this when column is clearer.
3. Studydesignegret by CRD
	1. Redundancy with scarification count, it's the same code that has been copy pasted. 
Therefore, I don't think they have been clean

In issue #43, lizzie mentions when warm strat--> pick warm strat

#### For Next week
-  #66 and check if Deirdre's text is fine. Read through her text and check if it's fine. 
- Clean treatment column.



#### Notes:

What should we do with figure and table duplicating? If data was in figure and table, we took table. Unless, the data was more complete in the figure. 

Duplicated data figure and table, we will need to check within a same experiment and within the same response variable range. 

Clean a new treatment column and create a new warm start column and check warmstrat. He cleaned cleaning and storage. 
Do the easy cleaning first, typos and dive in deeper after. 

### 9 October 2024
- If they manipulated germ duration, the treatments are light and dark. 
Check in the photoperiod column and in the light. Might be in the light and dark column. 
If it's already somewhere else, remove it. 

- Is it ok if I change stratification to cold.strat or warm.strat? Should we just input as stratification and change treatment temperature?
Confirm that cold strat is somewhere else. Ideally it should be removed. tbd lizzie will need to 

- If stratified # 15 days, should it be in treatment duration and input as warm strat or cold stra
Confirm it's there and deleting it.
- If treatment was scarification. It was input as scarified and non-scarified. I changed it to scarification and control. Is that fine?
Confirmation that it;s somewhere else. 
- In maithani90, the treatments were input as e.g. control lab and control nursery. I think I should change the experiment as lab and nursery.
Check in germ duration, and check germination temperature, we might need to drop nursery if it's under ambiant temperature. 

Meet with Lizzie about clean coordinates.

## 15 January 2025
Change to MS foundation
Change zadeh because it's a cultivar in the 

Check in with Ken about clean treatments. 

## 28 January 2025
#### Questions
- Duration is always in days
- Unc?
Chill temp duration.

Both check the columns and go through the code. Check the code is well organized. 
Check brandel05
Up

## 29 January issh
Check the command list in the world flora package. 20 minutes and try to implement it. 

Go back to the questions and see if we want to answer. anything else with the ospree dataset.

Read adam mcgill post on open access.

## 12 March
1-2 examples of the problems when pulling off the species and add it on the git issue. We need to figure out why species name from the function don't fit the ones on the website. 

Go through back to chillTempDuration and check the issue. 
Think about questions.        

## 26 March
**Phylogeny**: Add notes in the methods section: cleaned with worldflora then matched the synonyms of the tree with the cue database
**Karlsson08**: we agreed on Deirdre's comment, so rescrape only Dry storage. 
Look at song20 figure pannels. Update in the data folder and in input. 

## 9 April
Karlsson08: change 10+0 to 10 and add some notes that we assume the same temprature since the paper didnt't specify.
Song20: didnt change panels for figures i didnt rescrape. Changed them nom. Should i change my name. Change under my name. 
Phylogeny: 
Cleanchilltempduration: look up bataglia.

### To do :
Pritchard fig 2 should be removed ok
Bataglia look up issue 23. Bataglia is cleaned in the end of cleanall. If need to be rescraped. do it in issue.
