**On irrigation**, while putting the tubes, the number of pots in each lane should be counted and measured on the tubes to avoid putting extra holes or having to add some in the greenhouse.
- Indicate clearly which one goes where and how many there will be
- Buy better punchers as we struggled like crazy to punch them and lost so much time. 
**On [[Drought methodology]] : for the first defoliation, we brought trees that were leafed out (past phenological stage 3) in the growing chambers and defoliated them.
- We set similar photoperiod than the one outside, changing it weekly
	- This allows to isolate the drought variable to only study this impact on tree growth. 
- Photoperiod is adjusted weekly to the day outside, but the time at which the temperature drops and ries stays the same
	- The time of rise and fall of the temperature corresponds to the longest day of the summer which is at summer solstice.

- Trees that are selected for dendrometers must be chosen according to the space at the bottom and the straightness of the trunk
	- Especially for small trees like sequoia
	- Dont put etiquette at the bottom
