**Things to discuss with Freddi**
- Dates at which trees were in dormancy
- Should I include also a rectangle for defoliation 
- In the climate chambers, is it better if I extract the maximum and minimum value of each day and make the mean for a specific period of time, or I should make the mean of the hole daily interval that the temperature was up?
- When do we consider the start and end of a treatment, since it was species dependant
