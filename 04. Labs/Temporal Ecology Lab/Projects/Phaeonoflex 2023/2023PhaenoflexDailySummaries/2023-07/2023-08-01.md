###### Last week planning 



**Things done:** 

**Things left unfinished:**

**The following day to-do list:**

**Things to discuss with Freddi**
- Initial weight values prvi and bepa
	- [x] Standardize all species, all replicates by R 0 --> the veight measurements so 100% is actually R0 ✅ 2023-08-10
	- [ ]  If the estimated asymptote < 30, we use the mean asymptote from the replicates
	- [ ] We take the last weight measurements of each replicates and we divide it by the mean asympote of the replicates at which the estimated asymptote is > 30. 
	- [ ] Follow up on git with a list of tasks for the remaining steps
	- [ ] Change the initial values to the estimated R0 for all of them
	- [ ] Once this is done, send freddi an email to follow up on which replicates dont have a relevant asymptote [[Negative asymptote estimate soil moisture Phaenoflex]]
- SSasymp value
	- ok
- Malcolm Knapp
- issue on git
	- good i need to follow up with up
