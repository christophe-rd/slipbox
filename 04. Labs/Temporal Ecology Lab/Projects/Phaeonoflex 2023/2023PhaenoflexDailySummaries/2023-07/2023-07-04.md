#daily_note_active_project_PhaenoFlex_summer_2023

**Things to do**: 
- add comments where lizzie wanted me to
- notes: 
	- effects of variable

- get this shit done:

- select leaves that will be for phenolic compounds
- check the data for 39
- clean up mess on the counter

**Dendrometer**:

- Charge: 
	- **Climate chamber**:
		- Prvi dro2 r6 : plugged 
		- Quma dro2 r8: plugged
		- Prvi dro2 r8: plugged 
		- quma dro 2 r6: plugged
		- bepa dro2 r7 : plugged 
		- Bepa_dro2_R6 : plugged 
	- **Greenhouse**:
		- correct aligment of pico dro2 r8
		- bring back sicsors



Temperature figure 
1. Dormancy add an arrow to indicate that put them outdoor
	1. Black arrow written transfer
	2. Skip dormancy in legend, and instead add underneath the waves: cooling chambers
	DONE
2. Second axis for photoperiod in hours, its the day length.
3. Daily mean temperature (Degree celcius) for Y axis
4. X axis change for day-month instead of julian days
5. "2023" instead of time on x axis. 
6.  legend inside the square
7. defoliation treatment vertical arrow pointing at the start of the treatment
8. change to blue for dormancy
9. change arrows to green
10. Instead of "Legend" : "Treatment"
11. Order of the layers: grey zone, after drought treatments and heat wave, and last the temperature line. 


**Things done:** 
- keep writing defoliation
- camping is booked
- pico are moved away from cc

**Things left unfinished:**
- The y axis of the temperature graph is still not done

**The following day to-do list:**
- finish soil moisture correlation
- check if dendrometer 9 is ok, i might have unplugged it
- Change the sensor for 39 (i need to find one that works)

Plant removal
- if they show the first symptoms by the time  drought 1 would be over -->we remove them. 
- If they don't show strong symptoms (e.g. dessication-->dry foliage) --> compare soil moisture to drought 1
	- if it's equal or below the final values of drought 1, we remove them.  
- otherwise keep them in until first symptoms 

**Things to discuss with Freddi**
- [[Source limited growth by a decrease in leaf area]]
-
