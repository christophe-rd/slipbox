- select leaves that will be for phenolic compounds
- install dendrometer 32

- Unplug the chargers in the growth chamber
- check the data for 39.
- soil moisture measurements
- meet and take notes with mira

Temperature figure 
1. Dormancy add an arrow to indicate that put them outdoor
	1. Black arrow written transfer
	2. Skip dormancy in legend, and instead add underneath the waves: cooling chambers
	DONE
2. Second axis for photoperiod in hours, its the day length.
3. Daily mean temperature (Degree celcius) for Y axis
	DONE
1. X axis change for day-month instead of julian days
2. "2023" instead of time on x axis. 
	DONE
1.  legend inside the square
	DONE
1. defoliation treatment vertical arrow pointing at the start of the treatment
	DONE
1. change to blue for dormancy
	DONE
1. change arrows to green
	DONE
1. Instead of "Legend" : "Treatment"
	DONE
1. Order of the layers: grey zone, after drought treatments and heat wave, and last the temperature line. 
	DONE



**Things done:** 
- update of drought 2 soil moisture
	- verification of data is done
- update defoliation journal
- check camping 

**Things left unfinished:**
- The y axis of the temperature graph is still not done

**The following day to-do list:**
- keep writing defoliation
- finish soil moisture correlation


Plant removal
- if they show the first symptoms by the time  drought 1 would be over -->we remove them. 
- If they don't show strong symptoms (e.g. dessication-->dry foliage) --> compare soil moisture to drought 1
	- if it's equal or below the final values of drought 1, we remove them.  
- otherwise keep them in until first symptoms 

**Things to discuss with Freddi**
