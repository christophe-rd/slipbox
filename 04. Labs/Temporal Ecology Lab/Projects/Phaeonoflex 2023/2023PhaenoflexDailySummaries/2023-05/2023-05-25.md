**Discussion with Freddie**
6 days until we take off plants off drought chambers. We should look at the apex and how lumpy it is.

We dessicate them at low humidity until the first sign of lumping leaves, and then put them back at normal humidity for 2 weeks. 

To correlate dendrometer data to soil moisture measurements, since we don't have weight and soil moisture of those replicats, we take the weight at the beginning and at the end of the drought treatment. We calculte the negative exponentional curve from the 10 replicats and replace values with the ones of the weight of the 5 dendrometers replicats.
