##### **Plant removal**
**[[2023-06-30]]**
*to make better*
- if they show the first symptoms by the time  drought 1 would be over -->we remove them. 
- If they don't show strong symptoms (e.g. dessication-->dry foliage) --> compare soil moisture to drought 1
	- if it's equal or below the final values of drought 1, we remove them.  
- otherwise keep them in until first symptoms 


**[[2023-07-05]]**
At the end of the summer, in the table of drought treatment removal, we will add the radial growth, and #turgor_relaxation_potential

**Table** :
- Delta a: is the fully water expansion during a 24h cycle, in um. 
- Number or days in drought treatment 
- **Also** the number of days of shrinkage, cause when they come in the climate chamber, at first they are stimulated by the conditions, then it becomes a stress and they start to shrink, and its the number of days that they are shrinking that we want, and still show the #turgor_relaxation_potential  
Add and figure out a way to show the distance to asymptom

**On soil moisture curves:**
- Show correlation curve
- Then we choose the best between vwc or water loss
