In the following, are the replicates at which the asymptotes are <30. This is an arbitrary value that Freddi and I decided to be the threshold at which the percentage was to low to be accurate and was probably caused by a drying length that was not sufficient. Probably related to the leaf area of certain species. We will need to check those replicates.
