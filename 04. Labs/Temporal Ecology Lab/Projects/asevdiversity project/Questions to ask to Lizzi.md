- Paper id 391: can't recognize how many rootstocks were used
	- Question: Id 391: 19 genotypes were used to measure transpiration, but no explicit mention of scion or rootstock. Is it irrelevant in this paper?
- If two locations a one paper, should I put 2 rows?
	- Yes
- Question: Id 449: they checked the presence of bacteria on different rootstocks and scion from three different regions in Australia. Should this data be included?
- Comment: When no precise location, I take a central point in the region/city.
- Comment: I have an access problem  from: |SHS Acta Horticulturae. I have problems with my library access, I will go check at Woodward.
