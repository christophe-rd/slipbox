- Table with symptoms of drought treatments, individuals' specific
- On first methodology draft: always mention why we did something. The problem of warmer temperature in the greenhouse, how did we solved that, and how to prove that the temperature was not significantly different.
  
- **Tasks**: 
	- Calculate the negative exponential curve formula
	- Transform to log so its linear curve
	- Apply the formula to the dendrometer pots in order 
		- Check freddi's paper on chill to be forced
	- Follow up on the introduction and defoliation methodology
		- Second round
	- Follow up on drought methodology
		- First round
- Calculate leaf mass per tree, for defoliation.
	- Check if all species have the correct number of replicates
	- in master file defoliation, the doy of the defoliation
**Fall planning**
- help freddi with R codes and graphs for
	- Soil moisture
	- Temperature graph
- Writing TBD
	- Explain what I did in the graphs/methodology of it.
- Should be 1-2 days a week for a couple of months

**Time spent on the tasks for the following 3 weeks:**
- Writing: 2-3 days (16-24 hours)
- Temperature graph 2-3 days
- Linear exponential curve: 2 days
- Egret: 2 days

[[2023-07-13]]
### Methodology 
 - daily maximum of each day in july, then the mean of that.
- January the daily minimum
- Provide an example of heat wave in 2022, e.g. for 2 weeks a mean temperature of xxx and a maximum daily of xxx.
- Provide the data from another station in Vancouver, find a publication on that and extract the temperatures from that.


[[2023-07-23]]
-  Use mature trees, and how flexible trees in taking up nutriments. With water it would be very realistic. Sprinkler, that water for a whole week in order to release really quickly the drought. 
	- Take a carrot of the trees and show the cell growth before and after the growing season. 
- Could be done in Malcom Knapp research forest. Omogenous forest in terms of slopes and tree diversity. 
- Dendrometers are expensive
- Puncture before the treatment on 10 trees, and puncture after the treatment
- If a species is able to rapidly adapt to a drought release, they could have an advange. Again, its on how flexible species are to take advantage of an opportunity. **Also how well they can overcome internal restrictions**. 

###### To do for the following week :
- [ ] Buy seringues with a smaller seringe
- [ ] Third round of methodology with dendrometer data.
- [ ] Finish first round of introduction
- [ ] define most urgent needs: suitable field site, purchase seedlings. 
- [ ] write to Lizzie, we think its a good time to discuss next summer project, in terms of seedlings purchase, field site, and some ideas that we thought about. 
- [ ] Count how many replicates for the defoliation treatment, and add the mean mass for all of them.

[[2023-08-25]]
Species to add in Malcom Knapp email 
aler (alnus)
betula
Acer sp
populus
Quercus (ask for it )
Prunus
Any additional deciduous trees.

Define adult trees (30 years)


Regarding the estimated asymptote: 7 days and we compare it to the last measurement

[[2023-10-09]]
The difference with the 7 
We will take for the true asymptote only the replicates that showed severe drought treatments. We will take all drought treatments, this will be the 

[[2023-10-19]]
**Things to discuss**:
- Did you write for the space in the greenhouse?
- Determine when I arrive
- Order trees
- Order pots

Important: April we put them in the chambers. Wait until leaf out and we keep them in the climate chambers until leaf out. 

Only one species of European beech that is so photoperiod dependant. Very week effect. 

How much variance do tree species show in growth. 

Figure out if I need to go to the van to organize everything

1st of April

Discussing tree ordering

[[2023-12-12]]
We don't have to repot oak and big-leaf maple.
Red alder big size is really a problem. We will see if we can cut them.

Double the pots for white pine, sequoia, acer negundo. To 2 gallon pots. 
Maple and Oak: keep in pots, add soil
Birch and alder:  double pots and eventually (2nd season plant them outside)
Populus: cut them and plant them in soil in pots. They will all flush. Only one in the soil. Keep them moist. In 2 gallon-pots
Prunus: 2 gallon pots depending on root exploration

**Put this plan in the git issue** //done
Don't touch the roots too much
In general, look for root exploration. If they are dense: repot. 

- [ ] What are the dimensions of the climate chambers?
Fredi will send them
- [ ] Is the soil ordered?
Yes we have plenty. We should perhaps add clay in it since we don't do drought. 
- [ ] Do we have enough big pots?
Yes
- [ ] Do we plant the trees in big pots right away independently of their growing strategy?
see above
- [ ] Dendrometer installation: when I come in February, I align all of them. Install the dendrometers and make sure they are all charged.  Install all dendrometers in the climate chambers in February. 
- [ ] Did you talk to Lizzie about April?
Need to write to the undergrads 
- [ ] What's up with the 3 spring 
They will all be equipped with 3 springs. 
- [ ] Are they all troubleshooted? : 66 are working.
- [ ] How many dendrometers are working properly
If i have some spares, plant them in the soil to check if it's feasible to dig them out of the soil in Autumn.
- [ ] Pinning treatments
To discuss in Frebruary depending fredi's experiment

**Drying curves :**
Let's wait until we have biomass data. 

**Fuelinex experimental design**
Leaf out overlap with radial growth (around leaf out until end of June)
Shoot elongation: overlap with leaf out (end of may to mid june AND second flush to august) 
budset: mid july to beginning September

**Dendrometers**:
- Make sure the time shift problem is solved. 

Plans in April
1. Put all plants in the chambers in February
2. Ask Mao or undergrads
3. We have no one. We do the warming after leaf out. 

full factorial: separate the treatments. 

[[Tasks trip for Vancouver trip in February]]

In a day he managed to do 50 trees a day, for Fredi himself. 


### DATE TBD
##### Stuff to check with Fredi
**FUELINEX**
- [x] Pot organization in the climate chambers. We need to talk about room chamber effect since I won’t be able to fit all plants in them. ✅ 2024-01-25
Stack them. 
- [ ] Possibility to install a shelf in there
no
- [ ] Columns highlighted in the phenomonitoring excel spreadsheet.
- [ ] Why wood anatomy?
no
- [ ] Should we wash all the pots? 
not relevant anymore
- [ ] Room in the climate chambers
NA
- [ ] the organisation of the greenhouse 
look up in the emails. 
- [ ] Either we put them in April or in Frebruary in the climate treatments. 
Don't repot the trees in February but after the first warming treatment. 
- [ ] Alder and Poplar : put them first in water. Ask opinion to Rob. After they exit the climate chambers, put them back in soil. Do research on where and how to cut the stems. Is it the last year's wood. or third year, to have the same age. Only have one but where the leaves will leach. Save some space between soil so leaves wont be damaged. 
Something to keep in mind: either we cut the stem or we cut roots and shoots in Frebruary (in case cuttings on not feasible for alder)

#### Comments on phaenomonitoring spreadsheet
- [ ] Mark the bark with paint for diameter

**PHAENOFLEX**
**Third drought treatment ✅ 2024-01-25**
Start: July 31st 
End: same length as the second treatment
- [ ] When was the harvest 
Not one particular harvest date. Start November 11, Ended on December 11th.
- [ ] Temperature data for the climate chambers
Keep the temperature data from the 2nd treatment
*** change the color gradient
[[2024-02-07]]
#### Stuff to talk about
- [ ] Change to dendrometer charging
Make sure to install temperature sensors in the greenhouse in the shade. Control a little bit. Perhaps near the fan. 
- [ ] Stuff on white board
- [ ] Nitro addition, we could do pinning treatment then on them and on the controls. But not in the spring
Only for nutrient boost since it's a lot of work. 
- [ ] Spring and fall temperature, taking van temperature and advancing it 
Take the highest temperature that already occured. For a specific week.
Fluctuate between day and night. 10 degrees between day and night. 20 and 10. Maximum over the last 30 years. We want to test whether a warming boost has an effect. Only as complex as needed. 
- [ ] Modify the dendrometers so no battery is needed.
done
- [ ] Dendrometer : Send Fredi the design. 
- [ ] Monitor diameter biweekly for nutrient addition. 

[[2024-02-09]]
#### Stuff to talk about
- [ ] Rooting hormone for trees
Do this at the beginning. 
Remove the white chunks from the soil and plant them in the soil. 
- [ ] Poplars can't root, what do we do to propagate
- [ ] How do we change x axis in mongo
you can chose between last month, last week.
- [ ] Is it populus tremuloides or balsamifera
- [ ] Let's go with alder for the dendrometer data.
- [ ] 7 species equipped with dendrometers

For the double trunk, add column not row.

We measure diameter and height to estimate the biomass. 

[[2024-02-19]]
#### Stuff to discuss
- [ ] Repotting the trees
- [ ] When do we put the trees in the climate chambers?
We need to figure out whether we want to extand growing season or we keep the same length but give them a warming boost.
Ring porous species (e.g. oak) grow before leaf out. 

Decision: mid-March and species specific.

- [ ] What temperature do we set the climate chambers at?
Higher than expected. If we have a warm spring and we only manage to advance the treatment by 1 or two weeks.
We take the warmest period from the second half of March until April. For every year the mean temperature from mid-march to mid April. Mean daily and night temperature for every year during that period. See how much it fluctuates for the past 30 years. Taking the second week of April 
Problem with different temperatures every week. We are species-specific, so oak will have much warmer temperatures than birch since we will take them.
**We take the maximum mean temperature for a specific period.**

Decide how I decide the temperature for night and day. 
- [x] Sensor for the dendrometers ✅ 2024-02-22
- [x] How many man-hour required ✅ 2024-02-22
10 minutes
- [ ] Temperature sensors
The fan need to be working at all times
Have two loggers in the greenhouse than two in the climate chambers. One at plant height
- [x] Show him where I installed the sensor in GH ✅ 2024-02-22


##### To do :
Git issues of all the decisions. 
Argue whether I want to figure out which question I want to answer. 
Ask Mao to check the loggers. 
Have two loggers in the greenhouse

**Phaenoflex:** 
Change the temperature in the experimental design for 2023 temperature. 


[2024-06-27]
##### Things to discuss :
1. **Shoot elongation measurements**: 
	1. Is it a big deal if I have slightly different measurements from one week to another?
Maybe do it every second week.  It's, not that big of a deal, since we will still see growth stop even if there is a slight difference from one week to another. 

1. **Phenological monitoring**:
	1. Second flush monitoring: should we specifically monitor this or just by seeing it on the shoot elongation, is ok. 
Don't need to do that, because well see it in the shoot elongation measurements. 
	1. Bud set: Show pictures if some are currently starting to bud set
Take pictures of pines, quma, etc. of specific replicates so I can look at bud set in a couple of weeks. 
1. **Treatments**: now we don't have the possibility of having control. The cool/cool that was supposed to be the control isn't anymore. 
Reformulate my hypotheses so they are more precise. Also, start simulation of the data. 


 1. **Literature review**: how to do one using the slipbox? 
	 1. Which sections do I analyse? Intro, methods, results, discussion?
	 2. How thoroughly should I conduct it?
 2. **Biochambers schedule**: in the spring, the schedule wasn't great, should we optimize it in the fall?
	 1. Pros: getting more realistic, better lighting
	 2. Cons: not same method applied than in the spring
Its been shown that plants in the shade show delayed senescence. So if we put plants in the chambers with high lights, they might accelerate senescence earlier.: **Read this:** Effect of climate warming on the timing of autumn leaf senescence reverses at the summer solstice
Decision: keep it simple. Take a weekly maximum of the lighting outside and ramp it to the daily maximum. 

1. **Should we make a pause in irrigating the segi.** For 3 days, remove the drippers. 
Ask Dan to change the irrigation to once a day at the end of the day for all species. 
1. **For the lab meeting next week, do you have any research tools suggestions**?
2. **What should we do for the light differences between the different areas in the greenhouse**? Same for temperature. 
Shade gradient. Whether a tree could benefit from an extended growing season depending on the microconditions. Shade vs not. This gradient could be used to compare the same treatments but at different locations in the greenhouse.

4. Phaenoflex
 
 [2024-07-01]
 Litterature reviews
 Start with a review paper (and summarize it in notes. don't summarize what i already know), and then I go from there. Look for the papers cited in the
Search with elicit and google scholar. 
Web of science. 
Zotero: file structure on different topics: 1. nutrient stimulation 2. 
Set alerts in google scholar on specific keywords because they will be the most recent papers on the subject.
read 3-4 papers. Absorb the info and after I decide where I go from there. 
Intro, methods, etc. 
Read the intro, skip the methods for now. Start 

[2024-09-02]
#### Things to discuss:
- Should I measure diameter and height before and after fall treatment?
	- Just during the dormant period. 
	- Remark the point measured for diameter. 
- Interval I should measure leaf senescence?
	- Every week. 
- Method I should do leaf senescence
	- 1. Percentage of remaining green leaves. (Index of how green)
	- 2. 
1. Look at the plant. Access how much would be for a 100%. Maybe 10% was already fallen. Only take 10% accuracy, only the lowest and highest (5% and 95%)
2. Greenex index. I need to calibrate myself. There is one in the lab. Fredi, would just do it to calibrate myself. I take
Chlorophyll content 
2 values: 
1. Remaining green leaf area (%)
2. 3 measurements per tree. Eventually, I will find I don't need this anymore. 


Poplar: spots by disease, it is considered as senesce, For mildew: make a comment, but they still can have a high chlorophyll content. 
Where the soil moisture is. 

Treatment length. Fredi would leave all of them in the chambers, non species specific unless they all senesce. 

Nutrient addition. 4 times what I added during summer and water not crazy. Do that on Wednesday. Today: Stop irrigation at Totem. 

Agreed on segi. Tricky to have an imbalance in the design. 

Ramp less the temperature. 

Make a quick graph for the schedule.

### 18 December
Before collecting biomass, calculate before.
