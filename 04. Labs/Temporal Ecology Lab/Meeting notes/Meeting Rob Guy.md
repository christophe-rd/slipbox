#### Nutrient depletion treatments
Context: We want to give the trees a nutrient boost in the fall to examine if they can absorb nitrogen/phosphorus/potassium. 
We don't want to give plants too much nutrients in the summer to mimic natural conditions, but also to increase our chances to see a meaninful differences for the fall treatments. 
Soil is probably nutrient depleted
**Questions**:
- [ ] How would you add nutrients during summer? Would you wait for nutrient stress symptoms? 
- [ ] How can I be sure slow release fertilizer will be effective if we're using drippers?

He did experiments in the 90 on nutrient loading. There is a carryover.
Analysis of tissues said that the nutrients were in the plants in the fall and not in the spring. Meaning that plants could very well absorb nutrients in the fall.
In the fall, roots are still growing.

If we wash off the soil, there is probably still going to be nutrients. We need to check before and after we washed off. Really important: we want to test this before the treatments start. If we just remove the soil, then we will do a lot of damage to the roots. 
We should check the nutrient content in the leaves, at least. Or we can do some soil analysis. There is a soil lab in Victoria, they do soil analysis. They have a wait time and if I want to check my technique I need to check that very early.
Peet got no nutrients, crushed bark, not much either.  Therefore, most of nutrient that it's there is from last year's fertilizer. If I want to check if my seedlings are stressed, I need to check the leaves. They might not show stress, but they might stop growing. 
He thinks that testing the soil might not be necessary for now. 
1. I want to test if I can wash off nutrient soil out of the plants.
2. I want to monitor what's going on in the plants and analyze the tissues of the plants
He thinks nutrient boosting will delay senescence. He thinks the bark will be the main site of nutrient storing. For the evergreens, it might be in the leaves. **One of the questions will be where are the nutrients.**
Barbara Hawkins at Victoria Uni. She did a lot of work on nutrient uptake and seedlings. 

Some roots will be attached to the bark, so nutrients will probably 
Cat ion should be minimal because I don't have clay in the mix

I was right: if we release slow release. There will be some nutrient release, but not much
He agrees that adding nutrients manually in liquid. Add some now. 
Don't give them to much, Timmer paper will probably 
Twisting of needles, visual symptoms, I need to address

Budset 
##### Acne 
They form bud scales that slowly cover the apical meristem. For this species, the scales are modified leaves
#### Poplar
It's different, their scales are modified stipulus. They will eventually cover the terminal bud. 
As of today, some have started to set but, some are completely done. 
**keep in mind the provenance of the trees and the role that it can play in the experiment.**
They look nutrient stress. According to Rob, it can't be nitrogen nor calcium.
What's interesting, is one of the replicate threatened to set bud, elongated and stopped again and starts to set bud. We should definitely note if it's a lateral shoot or not. 
#### Quercus
They are setting bud right now. The tiny filaments that appear before the budset are stipulus. Their buds are usually pretty small. 

On their second flush: maybe the warm spring treatment set bud before the very warm temperature appeared. Unlike the cool spring where they could take advantage of the warm temperature in July and could grow more than the other treatments.
#### Segi
Keep in mind of the switch of directions. Cedars do that as well
#### Pist
Each bud is formed of other buds (compound buds). Under artificial lights, they can form crooked buds that grow away from the light. 
#### Bepa
They don't have real buds. It's pseudo buds. The apical meristem abords and the apical buds takes over. 
I should ask Lizzie about poplar phenology



### 28 October 2024
##### When to add nutrients again for the non-nutrient boosted trees?
2 and a half times as much. Do it on the pot size difference. Maybe more often. 1. after flush (mid-April) 2. May, 3. June 4. July. Same amount as last years, but in the end, they would.
