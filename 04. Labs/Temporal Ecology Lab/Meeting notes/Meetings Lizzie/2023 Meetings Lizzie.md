- Summer is going great, learned a lot on time management, R, git, etc.

1. I contacted a few researches from:
	1. Stockholm: Krystofer Hylander
	2. Queensland : Mathew Luskin
	3. Yale: Marylyse Duguid on plant diversity and composition 
- I thought about "coding heavy". I put a lot of thought into this and I think I am up to the task
	- I want to learn more about coding and thinking of taking coding classes to deepen my knowledge on this. 
- I think fieldwork is important for me. 

Get a screenshot of the git problem.

Create a issu and get Lizzie on it 
So I can add what I am doing 

Update the figure for asevdiversity. No rush on this.

Things to discuss: 
- Subject of next summer's project for nserc masters could it interfer with usra?
	- No, they dont care
- Is it ok the very long comment on asevdiversity
	- Shell get back to me tomorrow on this.
- 
5 species would be best. In terms statistics in the lab, it would be easier to do 5, and we might end up with less.
- Angiosperms decidious would be preferred.
- Look at the long term climate on how consistent the precipitation records are.
- As a backup, there is a field site that Elisa lake where there is a wet and dry site. It's an existing gradient 
- Water accessibility to the field site can be a problem, and people would mess with it. 
- Very not sure if manning park will have access
- Populus garden
- Natural conditions is worth, but just adult trees would be enough. On UBC campus. Lizzie doesnt see the advantage of natural condition 
- what provenance are the trees from. Have provenance effet.
- More similar adults to juvenile is a better argument
	- On the opposite, natural conditions and sampling if they are really similar we could apply those treatments, but low chances of that this will happend
- Adding benefit of doing locally on UBC. Factors to consider: genetics, lighting, precipitation, etc.
- Less variability in the data, all the same age core. 
- Oaks show natural conditions.
- Asking for trees on Campus
- Measure fruits accross the treatments.
- **Defoliation**: Depending what the data for this summer looks like, we could do this on mature trees. Impact of defoliation on fruit maturation. Ask Isabelle Chuine what they did, they did it on oak. 
	- https://hal.science/hal-03040087
	- Not do it only on oaks cause they develop over two years. 
	- On populus, they have a faster strategy of fruit maturation during  the same year. 
- Short figure that I could submit for my masters proposal. 

Find out whats there, replicate number, what can we order. Setka info, email Sally Aitken or Pia Smets. Email Lizzie on garry oak. Judy Myers for defoliation, say Lizzie sent me, she should be excited. 

Garry oak, populus.

Pros:
Adults:
- Fruits
- Not interested in interactions
Points
- Little forest right next to the green house.
