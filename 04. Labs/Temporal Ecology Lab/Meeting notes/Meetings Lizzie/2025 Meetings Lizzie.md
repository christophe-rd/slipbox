## 27 February 2025
I am not expecting any solutions. 

This is absolutely not on you and I simply want to share how I felt lately.

I am slowly realizing that the workload of the ongoing projects might be too much to be accomplished within the next year if I want to produce quality results while preserving my mental health. 

I am trying really hard to make progress on all these projects, but handling all of them simultaneously with a 1-year deadline makes me feel like I will corners. 

It feel like the workload of these projects would be better spread out over the course of a phD

- [ ] **Dendrometers:** 
	- [x] **Coin cell batteries replacement:** roughly 100$. Human hours: 4
	
	- [x] Fix sensors: make sure they are all properly working. Probably 10-12 human-hours

	- [x] Should they be set up on fuelinex? Could be interesting to see wood phenology X leaf phenology accross different species. 

Think about it. And maybe only install 20 of them.
- [x] **Should I apply for Peter Wall's award**? Due 31 March. 24k. 90% Research proposal (2 page proposal) and 10% supervisor's support letter. 
Check out people who got. 

- [x] **How long committee meeting should last for**
10-20 minute presentation. Aim for 15. 
Goal around the time I present. I want to get feedback from them. I am 9 months.
More carbon storage.
Fuelinex: focus.explain it in depth that will take a while to explain. This is underway, take feedback and I am interested in what to measure this year and analysis. 

Secondary additional project.
3 years of phenology for the common garden. 4 populations 4.5. Add the map. 2-3 slides.
Nice observational data. Lovely contrast. 
Get 

- [ ] **Line 69 of grephon manuscript. I don't understand.**

- [ ] **Directed studies. When? Project description?**
Maybe in the spring. Reading group. Check how many weeks. Check if it can be shorter. 
- [ ] **Repos WildSpotters**+ Neils notes.
Check for arbexplore. 
Robert Ducky rule. Work on code for an hour. Max 3 hours a day. Palmodaro.io
Emails from peter and Patrick no now. Put them in a folder and add a good readme. 

- [ ]  Treespotters data

July: picking up the cores. 

Check clean_ts and check april 2024. Check the data and see if it's worth coring the maples. 

Clean data in treespotters repo and add it in input in coringtreespotters. 

Keep treespottersOG, Lizzie will be creating 

Drop down to two weeks at some point during the summer for shoot elongation. 

#### Fuelinex 
Stop cleaning data. Maybe show shoot elongation. Keep good notes. Keep good metadata. 


April phenology monitoring: how long it was and ask Victor or Ken. 
CSEE: not this year.
