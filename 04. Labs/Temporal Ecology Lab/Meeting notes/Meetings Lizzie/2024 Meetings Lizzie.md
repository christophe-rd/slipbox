### 24 June 2024
Should we change how the plants are in the chambers to get the schedule better? : maybe get the same scheduele
###### What expected from me in the following weeks? 
Come up with a project

**Start an email on chamber maintenance**
**Greenhouse : check square footage** and email Lizzie about it
Ask Fredi what he thinks of the light gradient. Before, check if the gradient is strong enough to be included. If we could remove it, it would be better

We could do a small scale dendrometer study with perhaps one or 2 species. 

**For the summer:** 
- Start some analyses 
- Litterature reviews
**For egret retreat:**
- Be positive
- Clean up after you
- Work

Learn Latec and get your .bib folders work out. 

Ask Fredi, Deirdre and Lizzie how to do a litterature review. 

For Segi:
Kea woodruff from Sylva seeds. She said Segi are hard to grow. 

Email : Alana chin

### 5 July 2024
1. Literature review
Out of a literature review, you want to be efficient. You want to find a way to select. 
Out of the notes of papers, she writes down the notes from the papers and add them in tec. 
You want to have a good top 10 of papers.
Search for 20 minutes for different search terms and check. 
Don't start with more than 30 papers, aim for 20-30

Check the references in the papers, don't really go back to search other papers. 
1. Help in the following weeks
	1. Could Ken take over
2. light gradient in the greenhouse


Search terms: phenology*
plant*
growth*
Search for lizzie's favourite phenology papers. 

**Good review journals:**
New phytologist 
trees
Annual review

Don't search only for trees, also for plants
Search heteroparity, and homoparity in Ecology books. 
Read chapter 4 in Lizzie's Ecology book.

Read books.

Start with reading the abstract and introduction. Don't bother with methods and results. 
Check the annual review, on plants. 
Check for how trees grow. 
Perspectives and opinions, read on that. 

**(As of Today July 3)*
Shoot elongation measurements**
Acne: probably stopped 
Bepa: still elongating
Pist: probably stopped
Poba : still elongating
Prvi : probably stopped
Quma : still elongating 
Segi: still elongating

Human hours: 8/week

**Phenomonitoring:**
**Bud burst:**
Segi

 0.5 /week

Keep it under 5-6 hours per person. 
Britany, Ken and Justin meets with Rob.
Ask Selena

**Budset (estimated dates are for stage 5 (fredi’s stage 3) :**
Acne: estimate = August 15
Bepa : estimate = August 15
Pist: estimate = na
Poba : estimate = Mid July
Prvi :  Ongoing
Quma : estimate = August 1st
Segi: estimate= late august

Human hours: 2/week.

In the daily: we measured until they were not elongating more than. 
Make a measurement after 3 weeks after we stopped
Airbnb Mount Rainier. ask Mao

Lizzie's project ideas: Arnold arboretum. 

Resubmit for NSERC.

### 29 August 2024

Sylvia Ho. Send an email. 

Treatment, max average temperature for each week. 
Feel crowed.

Estimate how many hours 

How many points in the curve I need to monitor senescence? Simulate how much data I need to run the curve. 

Two back-up. List 
1. Cores from common garden at Arnold Arboretum. 
2. Permit from citizen science. Have a few years of data. Should take about 2 days of work. 
3. Dendrometer experiment next 
#### Work on 
1. Literature review
2. Timeline towards graduation. 
3. Email Lizzie every week to tell her what's up. 
4. Ask Deirdre about the common garden. 

### 3 September 2024
##### Things to discuss:

#### Projects 
###### Fuelinex
- [ ] Dendrometers  troublesooting took roughly 20 human hours;
Set up the git issue file on the troubleshooting file. 
	- [ ] 26 with a least one weird thing. E.g:
		-  Nothing on mongo. 
		-  No displacement (like 1um) compared to other sthat displaced 100 on same tree. 
		-  3 spring added on sensors are not glued properly
		-  Extreme variation. 
		-  Sensor light not working
	- [ ] Should I reach out to OpensLab?
**Yes email them.** 
Ask Ken if he wants 
- [ ] Spring project Idea:
`5.1.1. Testing bud burst responses to different photoperiods. We could do this by submitting trees under the same temperature conditions, but with different photoperiods. This idea arose from a paper I read that mentioned it would be interesting to test this.
`5.1.2. Look into the link between growth and bud burst. Treatments would be the temperature regime i.e. chamber 1 is at +10C, chamber 2 is at 5C and the other at 0C. Photoperiod would be the same across the treatments.''

###### Cookie spotters
- [ ] Won't respect the deadline as I need to wait for Adam to produce images.

- [ ] Cookies data processing: imageJ vs coorecorder. Mac vs PC

- [ ] Opinion on crossdating cookies? 

- [ ] Authorship Neil
	- Added notes on my meetings with him.
Neil and Lizzie for sure. 

Check for archives. 

Prove that the images I measured with imageJ are ok with coorecorder. Do it before I go away.

Ask Fredi his methods for biomass collection. 
Check about the drying oven. 
##### Proposed timeline
- [ ] Fuelinex: If I harvest trees at the earliest in October:
	- 1 month to dry, then :
		- Biomass measurements
		- Sanding tree rings of 600 trees.
		- Images of 600 trees. Will take a long time. 
- [ ] Semester abroad:+ drop it?
