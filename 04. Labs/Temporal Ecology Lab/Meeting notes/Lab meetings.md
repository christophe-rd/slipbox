What is a Guaussian process.
Prior of your function relationship and the idea it to get the ups and downs of the data. 
f ~ multinormal(mean, covariance matrix)
Most classical covariate function is called exponentiated

Marginal deviation controls height of the wiggles.

Using ring width instead of basal area increment is just a matter of how I want to look at my data. If I convert ring width to basal area, then I add uncertainty at the beginning by using basic analytical equations.
