#### Questions

- [ ] Should the first ring after the pit be counted?
Yes it's year 1. 
Right on the boundary of the ring
- [ ] What to do with empty hearts? Estimate pit distance?
Estimate the pit as best I can. But it's not relevant. I could substract what's missing. 
- [ ] Should I do one or multiple replicates per cookie?
3, and maybe 4. 120 degrees for 3 radius nor precise.
  - [ ] Which direction?
for two, it would be long and short side
  - [ ] How to be consistent?

- [ ] What are the darker lines between the rings. Consistent way to evaluate wether they are real or false rings?
interannual density fluctuations i.e. false rings. Cells that go through the ring boundaries is a way to determine false rings. They also tend to happen more in fast growth years, with a drought spell. 

- [ ] Should I use Cofecha for this project vs DPLR?
Measure it, with young trees, I won't find any correlation. Try it. Cofecha. Plotting them in Coorecorder will be my best. H
- [ ] Should I save all of my files from Coorecorder in .pos AND .txt?
Save everything. Export and save a JPEG of the decisions I made. 
- [ ] Advice on wether to use Zinc oxyde/Kerosene?
Good sanding does it. Use a marker and rub in talc. Look into the tropical with their methods . Orbital sander. 
- [ ] General workflow with Coorecorder or othe software?

  - [ ] Count rings of all cookies first and then move to CDendro, Cofecha...

- [ ] Need to crossdate since all trees were harvested the same year?

- [ ] Should I worry about the heigh at which the cookies were harvested?
I should be conservative about dating rings. 

Zoom out approach because I can get lost in diffuse porous trees. 

  #### Cookies to check
- [ ] AlNINC HF3 P16: should the ring around  the pit be counted?
- [ ] BETALL GR13 P2
  - [ ] Should I measure one short side, then the longer one?
  - [ ] What to do when there are 2, 3 pits?
  - [ ] False rings?

-  [ ] BETALL GR12 P3
  - [ ] Ring around the pit?
  - [ ] False rings?
  number 2 
  Statistics wont be helping me. 
  Check in around the 26. Has to be before 2PM if it's Friday.

- [] BETPOP GR5B P12
  - What if the orientation was in the way the knot was. What should I do?
The first ring around the pit isnt a ring

##### Trees to check
- Take on the 3 angles thing
- Should I be better just to check their ring increment, without going through coorecorder -- problem with size. ImageJ
Stockten Maxwell compared coorecorder and another program. I need to show that my way is good. Need to convince. I could add a lots of notes. 
What to do when proposed lines cannot be measured?

- ALNINC GR11 P1: Is the thick ring around the pit real?
- ALNINC HF1 P1: 180 degrees ch -- RESAND
- ALNINC HF5 P6: 0 degrees the ring around the pit
- BETALL SH9 P9: Diagonal lines? Pit? Take the most central one. Find the ring boundaries, if it includes a lot of wounds, it's biomass. It doesn't seem logical that have grown. 2023 ring didn't start. 
- BETPOP WM7 P15 full ring from the previous year. 

If I am gonna do biomass, should I mesure the outer ring. I should measure the outer ring and say it's a partial ringZ
Make a lot of notes about all of the difficult decisions.  
Search literature in Europe for tree ring techniques on plants and herbaceous.

Questions on specific cookies -- > in .md file

Generic questions:
- If they all leafed out, did they start radial growth already?
- How can I be consistent in calling 2022 or 2023 growth?
- Pit, should I go strait in the middle or go first at the boundary?

	Cannot have more than 6 rings. Outer ring is too large to be 2023.  
	4-5 cells wide. Diffuse porous species: peak growth. Neil doesn't expect growth in 2023, maybe  

We don't know which individuals were harvested in may/
Most of the cookie would have been harvested in late summer. 
Alnus were harvested in spring. 
More cores 
If it has a core, it's likely that they had a later cookie.

Exclude juveniles: oldschool thinking

Cores, take only cookies for which I have cores. Match the patterns. 

Edward H. (Ted) Hogg: worked with populus saplings. He did dendro with these.  

Could do marker with telk

Sugar maples: hardest.

Patrick Fonti. Reach out to him and tell him Neil sent me. Tell him

Alan Crivellaro : very 

Books from screenshot: Fritz Schweingruber
1,2,4 of his books for marker and chalk. 

Trees were planted in 2017, but they were germinated from seeds at different times. 

Talked to Lizzie after and said that I could use a mixture model to select which rings are fitting with whitch. Didnt get this. Doesn't think that sitting down with a microscope will be helpful.
